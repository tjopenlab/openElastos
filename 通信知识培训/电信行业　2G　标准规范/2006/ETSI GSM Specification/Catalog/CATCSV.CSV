Besides these basic telecommunications services, features whic h aim at up grading these basic services need also to be offered. Due to the use of radiocommunications in a PLMN, which are of a special na ture compared to classical distribution transmission techniques used i n the fixed networks, such a category of features is related to securi ty aspects. In a GSM PLMN, both the users and the network operator have to be prot ected against undesirable intrusion of third parties. However, measure s should be provided for in order to insure maximum protection of the rights of the individuals concerns. As a consequence, a security featu re is either a supplementary service to Tele or Bearer services, which can be selected by the subscriber, or a network function involved in the provision of one or several telecommunication services.

Stage 2 identifies the functional capabilities and information flows needed to support the service described in stage 1. Furthermore, it identifies various possible physical locations for the functional capabilities.

The objective of this Harmonized Standard is to ensure that no disturbance occurs to the PTN, and to ensure interworking btw. PTN and TETRA terminals and btw. TETRA terminal to TETRA terminal so that the communication can be routed successfully through the applicable network(s). The requirements in this Harmonized Standard apply together with the attachment requirements for the appropriate PTN and the requirement of any other applicable Harmonized Standard . It does not add or reduce the attachment requirements unless there is a particular effect on the network which is unique to TETRA. Note: appropriate PTN refers to Harmonized Standard for basic rate ISDN, Harmonized Standard for primary rate ISDN or national regulations (implemeting ETS 300 001) for PSTN.  TETRA terminal equipment consists of several elements. This  Harmonized Standard is structured to allow testing and approval of the individual elements as separate items. Because of the need for effective use of the radio frequency spectrum, the essential air interface characteristics shall be tested. For each essential requirement, a test is given including measurement methods. Requirements apply to the public network interface and the RF Air Interface of the equipment, which may be stimulated to perform the tests by additional equipment, if necessary. Terminal equipment may be subject to additional requirements in other applicable CTRs or Directives depending on the functionality (primary functions). This Harmonized Standard is based on the radio and protocol provisions of ETS 300 394. This document is a general Harmonized Standard for TETRA terminal equipment, however, only certain applications are subject to Directive 91/263/EEC and hence covered by a CTR. It is therefore necessary to check with the relevant CTR as to the applicability to specific applications. "

However, most speech recognition systems have a feature extraction front end which performs a significant level of data reduction, to a bit rate capable of being transmitted over most fixed and mobile networks. The project seeks to standardise this front end, allowing a wide range of different speech recognition systems and applications to provide full support to mobile and cordless handset users.

It contains an evaluation of perceived threats to 3GPP and produces subsequently a list of security requirements to address these threats.  As teleservices and applications will not, in general, be standardised, it is difficult to predict their exact nature. Therefore, this specification considers all security threats and aims at listing generic security requirements that shall be applicable irrespective of the actual services offered. The list of threats and requirements may however need to be updated as the 3GPP system evolves. The threat analysis performed relies to a large extent on previous experiences with 2G systems, in particular GSM, and takes into account known problems from that area.  The security requirements listed in this specification shall be used as input for the choice of security features and the design of the 3GPP security architecture as specified in [2].  The structure of this technical specification is as follows: clause 2 lists the references used in this specification; clause 3 lists the definitions and abbreviations used in this specification; clause 4 contains a reference to the general objectives for 3G security; clause 5 contains an overview of the context in which the security architecture of 3G is designed; clause 6 contains a list of identified security threats to 3G, and gives some results from the threat analyses that have been performed; clause 7 contains an overview of the risk assessment resulting from the threat analyses performed clause 8 contains the resulting list of security requirements for 3G and indicates how these requirements relate to the threats and the security objectives . Finally, Annex A gives some more detailed information on threats and risks connected to so called false base station attacks. "

The document defines requirements of the USIM (Universal Subscriber Identity Module) and the IC card for 3GPP (UICC). These are derived from the service and security requirements defined in 3GPP 22.01 and 22.00. The USIM is a 3GPP application on an IC card. It inter-operates with 3GPP terminals and provides access to 3GPP services. The document is intended to serve as a basis for the specification of the USIM, the UICC, and the interface to the 3GPP terminal. 3GPP work area: TSG Terminals, WG3 (USIM). Linked work items: - UICC physical and logical characteristics; - USIM characteristics Service aspects: - Service requirements from 3GPP 22.00 and 22.01 shall be taken into account.

After the completion of a description document, the drafting of the protocol specification should not have to face difficulties which  would impact the other protocols i.e. the radio interface protocol architecture should be stable.

In analogy with CCITT Recommendations I.130 [1] and with reference to CCITT Recommendations VI.1 Q.65 (Stage 2 of the method for the characterisation of services supported by an ISDN), the second stage of the following three-level structure is derived from a stage 1 service description. Stage 1 is an overall service description, from the service subscriber s and user s standpoints, that views the network as a single entity which provides services to the user.  Stage 2 identifies the functional capabilities and information flows needed to support the service described in stage 1. Furthermore, it identifies various possible physical locations for the functional capabilities. The output of Stage 2, which is signalling system independent, is used as an input to Stage 3, the design of signalling system and switching Recommendations.  Stage 3 defines the signalling system protocols and switching functions needed to implement the service described in stage 2. "

This service has two parts: precedence and pre-emption. P recedence involves assigning a priority level to a call in combination with fast call set-up. Pre-emption involves the seizing of resources, which are in use by a call of a lower precedence, by a higher level p recedence call in the absence of idle resources. Pre-emption can also involve the disconnection of an on-going call of lower precedence to a ccept an incoming call of higher precedence. The eMLPP service is provided as a network operator s option to a doma in of a network. The domain can be the whole network or a subset of th e network. The eMLPP service applies to all network resources in the d omain that is in common use. The eMLPP service is applicable to all mo bile stations in the domain with all or some mobile stations having a respective subscription assigning precedence according to the eMLPP se rvice. eMLPP is a supplementary service and shall be provided to a subscriber for all basic services subscribed to and for which eMLPP applies. NOTE:	It is under study whether normal GSM phase 2 mobile stations wil l be able to be used for this service. The service is described from the service subscriber s and user s poin t of view, in particular: -	the procedure for normal operation with successful outcome;  -	the action to be taken in exceptional circumstances;  -	the interaction with other GSM services and features.  This ETS does not deal with the Man-Machine Interface (MMI) requiremen ts, but makes reference to the appropriate Global System for Mobile co mmunications (GSM) specifications. This ETS is applicable to telese vices 1x and 6x and to all bearer ser vices used in a mobile network according to the digital cellular telec ommunications system GSM if eMLPP is provided. Any interaction with ot her services and/or networks not dealt with in sections 8 or 9 are out side the scope of this ETS. "

In the case of BSSs where the speech transcoder is located remotely in the Base Station Controller (BSC), the implementation of the interfaces between the DTX handlers and the Radio Sub System (RSS) as described in this draft ETS together with all their flags is mandatory, being part of the A-bis interface as described in GSM 08.61.  The DTX functions described in this technical specification are mandatory for implementation in the GSM MSs. The receiver requirements are mandatory for implementation in all GSM BSSs, the transmitter requirements only for those where downlink DTX will be used. "

All supplementary services may require signalling on the radio path. Signalling procedures and messages used are defined in the GSM 04.8x and 04.9x-series of technical specifications. For some supplementary services information needs to be transferred between the home location register (HLR), the visitor location register (VLR) and the mobile services switching centre (MSC). Signalling procedures for such information transfer are defined in technical specification GSM 09.02. Definitions and descriptions of supplementary services are given in the GSM 02.8x and 02.9x-series of technical specifications. Definitions are given in technical specification GSM 02.04.

In analogy with CCITT Recommendations I.130 [1] and with reference to CCITT Recommendations VI.1 Q.65 (Stage 2 of the method for the characterisation of services supported by an ISDN), the second stage of the following three-level structure is derived from a stage 1 service description. Stage 1 is an overall service description, from the service subscriber s and user s standpoints, that views the network as a single entity which provides services to the user.  Stage 2 identifies the functional capabilities and information flows needed to support the service described in stage 1. Furthermore, it identifies various possible physical locations for the functional capabilities. The output of Stage 2, which is signalling system independent, is used as an input to Stage 3, the design of signalling system and switching Recommendations.  Stage 3 defines the signalling system protocols and switching functions needed to implement the service described in stage 2. "

The first phase focuses on the requirements necessary to elaborate the radio interface and the security aspects for an application supporting the speech tele-service (including DTMF support) in a residential single cell environment. As a consequence, a full business environment with all services is not considered. In particular, hand-over between CTS fixed parts or between CTS and GSM PLMN is not considered.

This Global System for Mobile communications Technical Specification ( GTS) does not address the following: -	There is no need for optimization of the routing of calls originally directed to a fixed network subscriber, because the physical address of a fixed network terminating line cannot differ from its logical add ress.  -	SOR in non-GSM mobile networks is not a subject of this GTS, but mig ht be possible by bilateral arrangement between GSM network operators and those non-GSM mobile network operators.  The purpose of SOR is to reduce the number of unnecessary inter-PLMN c all legs. The first phase of SOR applies to: -	OR performed within a country (i.e. Mobile to mobile calls where bot h mobile subscribers are located in the same country);  -	OR performed towards the country where the call would have normally been routed without OR (e.g. Conditional Call Forwarding towards the H ome Country of the called party).  The complete set of scenarios included in the phase 1 of OR is present ed in the paragraph for normal procedures. All other scenarios are exc luded from Phase 1 of OR. Note that Optimal Routing is applicable to national roaming situations , that is to calls directed to a mobile subscriber roaming in her home country, but registered in a PLMN different from her HPLMN. All further call scenarios, including multiple call forwarding, are le ft to subsequent phases of SOR. Subsequent phases of SOR shall be back wards compatible with this first phasd. "

These requirements apply to terminals for Phase 2+ of the public land mobile radio service, operating in the 900 MHz band with a channel separation of 200 kHz, utilising constant envelope modulation and carrying traffic channels according to the Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) principle. This EN specifies the terminal equipment HSCSD requirements for the GSM900 version of the Global System for Mobile communications (GSM). For each test purpose and its corresponding conformance requirement, a reference is given to the test method in EN 300 607-1 (GSM11.10-1)[2]. The requirements apply at the air interface and the Subscriber Identity Module - Mobile Equipment interface for the access requirements, which may be stimulated to perform the tests by additional equipment if necessary. The measurement uncertainty is described in EN 300 607-1 (GSM11.10-1)[2]. This EN covers the essential requirements of the Terminal Directive 91/263/EEC[1] Articles 4d, 4e, 4f.  The Terminal Directive 91/263/EEC[1] Articles 4a and 4b are covered by other directives, and, therefore, not by this EN. In this EN, there are no Electromagnetic Compatibility technical requirements in terms of the Terminal Directive 91/263/EEC[1], Article 4c. NOTE 1:Technical Requirements for EMC performance and testing of the equipment are covered by the relevant standards applicable to the EMC Directive 89/336/EEC, annexA. This module specifies the HSCSD Terminal equipment additional requirements.  EN 300 607-1 (GSM11.10-1)[2] constitutes the conformance test suite for GSM. The verification of the conformance requirements in this EN is based on the tests described in this reference. The set of requirements in EN 300 607-1 (GSM11.10-1)[2] and the set of requirements in this EN need not be identical. All the requirements in this EN are specific to mobile stations supporting HSCSD. An active accessory is covered by this EN if it modifies the terminal performance in an aspect which affects conformance to essential requirements. NOTE 2:Only active devices are subject to this EN. Accessories may be tested with specific terminals, and either approved for use with those terminals only, or may possibly be approved for use with a wider range of terminals, depending on the nature and effect of the accessory.

The main field of application of P-MP systems is to provide access to both public and private networks, particulary for remote subscribers. By means of P-MP systems the network service area may be extended to cover both distant and scattered subscriber locations.  Subscribers to be offered a full range of services by the public/private network and to have access via various standard interfaces (2 wire loop, ISDN,....).  The frequency bands above 3GHz are particularly suitable for the extension of telecomms. services to rural and suburban subscribers. P-MP systems provide standard network interfaces and transparently connect subscribers to the appropriate network node. These systems allow a service to be connected to a number of subscribers ranging from a few users to several hundred and over a range of distances.  P-MP systems are generally, but not necessarily, configures as pre-assigned systems or as Demand Assigned Multiple Access (DAMA) radio systems.  The essential features of a typical P-MP DAMA radio system are: -   efficient use of the radio spectrum; -   concentration; -   transparency.  Radio is often the ideal way of obtaining communications at low cost and almost independent of distance and difficult topography. Moreover a small number of sites are required for these installations thus facillitating rapid implementation and minimising maintenance requirements of the systems.  Concentation means that m subscribers can share n radio channels (M being > n) allowing a better use to be made of the available frequency spectrum and at a lower equipment cost. The term multi-access derives from the fact that every subscriber has access to every channel (instead of a fixed assignment as in most multiplex systems). When a call is terminated the channel is released for another call. Concentration requires the use of distributed intelligent control which in turn allows many other operation and maintenance functions to be added.  Transparency means that the exchange and the telephone communicate with each other without being aware of the radio link. "

There is a growing interest in the development and the future deployment of Broadband Satellite Multimedia Systems. WRC 97 has allocated and confirmed allocation of new frequencies for such systems. Already the US FCC awarded several licenses to construct, launch and operate such systems, for providing Broadband Satellite Multimedia services. These Systems under development are expected to be deployed around the year 2001/2003. The European Commission is concerned about the prospects of the European industry, operators and users in this area. In particular in the EU Action Plan: Satellite communications in the Information Society (COM(97)0091 - C4-0131/97), the speedy harmonization of technical standards for advanced, broadband, multi-media satellite terminals and receivers was highlighted. There is a need to promote the technical standardization at international level through ETSI, but the contact with all these new players is very difficult and cannot be performed in the framework of a voluntary committee activities. A survey is necessary to get a clear picture of the standardization situation , of the different types of terminals, systems ( geostationary, MEO or LEO), and frequencies. The survey will report of the contact with all possible players. Regulatory problems will be analysed in the survey on Broadband Multi-media via Satellite, in particular those which are hindering the future deployment of such systems. Considerable resources are required to collect information, analyse, liaise with other relevant fora and draft standards. This can only be achieved within a short time scale with the support of a dedicated Specialist Task Force. ETSI supporting Members: Alcatel, Ericsson, Motorola, DASA."

The objective of this TBR is to ensure that no disturbance occurs to the PTN, and to ensure interworking btw. PTN and TETRA terminals and btw. TETRA terminal to TETRA terminal so that the communication can be routed successfully through the applicable network(s). The requirements in this TBR apply together with the attachment requirements for the appropriate PTN and the requirement of any other applicable TBR. It does not add or reduce the attachment requirements unless there is a particular effect on the network which is unique to TETRA. Note: appropriate PTN refers to TBR for basic rate ISDN, TBR for primary rate ISDN or national regulations (implemeting ETS 300 001) for PSTN.  TETRA terminal equipment consists of several elements. This TBR is structured to allow testing and approval of the individual elements as separate items. Because of the need for effective use of the radio frequency spectrum, the essential air interface characteristics shall be tested. For each essential requirement, a test is given including measurement methods. Requirements apply to the public network interface and the RF Air Interface of the equipment, which may be stimulated to perform the tests by additional equipment, if necessary. Terminal equipment may be subject to additional requirements in other applicable CTRs or Directives depending on the functionality (primary functions). This TBR is based on the radio and protocol provisions of ETS 300 394. This document is a general TBR for TETRA terminal equipment, however, only certain applications are subject to Directive 91/263/EEC and hence covered by a CTR. It is therefore necessary to check with the relevant CTR as to the applicability to specific applications. "

In addition to the DVB access technologies DVB-S, DVB-C, DVB-T, DVB-SMATV, DVB-MC and DVB-MS (EN 300 421/429/744/473/748/749) with the interaction channels for interactive broadcast services (EN/ETS 300 800/801/802/(1)195/199/205), the IHDN-HAN specification will focus on the definition of new interfaces and network terminations (NT), such as an xDSL modem or an external cable modem. The existing DVB transmission systems form part of the HAN architecture, but access the IRD without any influence from other sections of the HAN. Different versions of HAN are possible. The HAN for use with an active NT is based on an ATM interface operating at 25 or 51 Mbps. The IEEE 1394 interface with the long reach extension has been selected for the HLN. Extension of the DVB interactive systems reference model with the IHDN. The network clouds show logically the association to corresponding services (broadcast, interactive broadcast, interactive multimedia services). Physically they may overlap and not all of them may be used in parallel. The broadband access network is new; which enables broadband multimedia services, such as video on demand and switched digital broadcast, over twisted pair lines with an xDSL modem. It may also be used for interaction purposes in combination with any broadcast delivery network.   "

Stage 2 identifies the functional capabilities and information flows needed to support the service as described in Requirements of High Speed Circuit Switched Data (HSCSD), GSM 01.34 [6]. Furthermore, it identifies various possible physical locations for the functional capabilities. The output of Stage 2, which is signalling system independent, is used as an input to Stage 3, the design of signalling system and switching Recommendations. "

The functions include the administrative procedures for both the subscriber (for example  provision of service ), and the equipment identified by the IMEI. Also included is the management of subscriber data necessary for network management. The managed functional entities involved are the Home Location Register (HLR), Visitor Location Register (VLR), Mobile Switching service Centre (MSC), Equipment Identity Register (EIR), Authentication Centre (AUC). The administration of subscriber data in all these entities is part of this ETS; which includes the means for a PLMN Operator to create, update, and delete information concerning a particular subscriber in order to allow (or bar) the use of the network.

The use of this tra nscoding scheme for other applications has not been considered. In GSM 06.01, a reference configuration for the speech transmission ch ain of the digital cellular telecommunications system is shown. Accord ing to this reference configuration, the speech encoder takes its inpu t as a 13 bit uniform PCM signal either from the audio part of the mob ile station or on the network side, from the PSTN via an 8 bit/A-law t o 13 bit uniform PCM conversion. The encoded speech at the output of t he speech encoder is delivered to a channel encoder unit which is spec ified in GSM 05.03. In the receive direction, the inverse operations t ake place. This ETS describes the detailed mapping between input blocks of 160 sp eech samples in 13 bit uniform PCM format to encoded blocks of 260 bit s and from encoded blocks of 260 bits to output blocks of 160 reconstr ucted speech samples.  The sampling rate is 8000 sample/s leading to a n average bit rate for the encoded bit stream of 13 kbit/s. The coding scheme is the so-called Regular Pulse Excitation - Long Term predicti on - Linear Predictive Coder, here-after referred to as RPE-LTP. This ETS also specifies the conversion between A-law PCM and 13 bit un iform PCM. Performance requirements for the audio input and output par ts are included only to the extent that they affect the transcoder per formance. The ETS also describes the codec down to the bit level, thus enabling the verification of compliance to the ETS to a high degree o f confidence by use of a set of digital test sequences. These test seq uenc s are described and are included in this ETS on diskette. "

The cordless transmission for such terminal equipment operates  within the frequency band 1880 - 1900 MHz.  A DECT-terminal equipment comprises two elements, referred to as a Fixed Part (FP) and a Portable Part (PP). The objective of this TBR is to ensure air-interface interoperability beteween a FP and a PP following the DECT/GSM interworking profile IWP (Note 2), where these parts are capable of 3,1 kHz telephony applications, and where the FP is connected to the GSM PLMN in order to provide GSM services (according to TBR 19/20) over the DECT air-interface.  For functional parts of a FP, that are terminal equipment, which are declared to conform to the basic CTRs for DECT (Note 1) and to the DECT/GSM IWP, the requirements of this TBR shall apply, in addition to the attachment requirements for the appropriate GSM PLMN.  The requirements of this TBR are also applicable for the complete set of functionality of a PP declared to conform to the DECT/GSM IWP. For a PP, this TBR is in addition to the basic CTRs for DECT.  Where a feature is indicated as optional, it need not to be provided. But where such a feature is provided, the FP and/or PP shall conform to the requirements and tests of this TBR. This TBR is structured to allow type approval of the FP and PP as separate items. For each requirement in this TBR, a test is given, including measurement methods where applicable. The terminal equipment may be stimulated to perform the tests by additional equipment if necessary.  This TBR does not apply to FPs where they form part of the GSM PLMN.  Note 1: The basic CTR fordDECT are the general attachment requirements (CTR 6), requirements for telephony applications (CTR 10) and requirements for Generic Access Profile (CTR 22).  Note 2: With respect to this TBR, the DECT/GSM IWP is based on the provision of access mappings/ interworking requirements of ETS 300 370 and the general description of of services, capabilities and information flows of prETS 300 466.

Remarks: (agreed at TA21) The proposed scope is technically feasible. It results in offering two interface accesses (ETS 300 325 and Common-ISDN-API v2.0). The interfaces can be offered in a way, which guarantees binary compatibility to applications conforming to either specification. The code between the interface and the hardware, may or may not be common to both interface accesses. The code for the interface accesses shall comply with the definitions made for each interface, independant of whether the code is common or only able to drive one of the interface specifications. Future enhancements can be performed in a way, which does not destroy this binary compatibility. Consequently, this revision of ETS 300 325 shall maintain both descriptions (ETS 300 325 and Common-ISDN-API v2.0) besides a part, which contains common aspects and overall features. With this development future implementations will ensure cross compatibility between both specifications.

TFTS will operate in the frequency band 1670-1675 MHz (ground to air) and 1800-1805 MHz (air to ground). The modulation technique is /4 DQPSK. The system is cellular in nature and the availablespectrum will support up to 164 radio channelswhich may be reused between cells. Each radio channel will support four voice telephone circuits operating with a 9,6 kbit/s voice coding alogorithm. The objective of this TBR is to define the minimum requirements  for conformance testing of TFTS Aircraft Station (AS). This shall include testing of the radio interface in terms of RF parameters and basic interworking tests. The interworking tests include a set of tests over the CTU/AT interface which conform to ARINC 746 Attachment 11 characteristics. For non-ARINC 746 aircraft the TBR includes interworking tests based on the AT plus the terminal equipment configuration. This TBR covers the essential requirements of the TTE Directive 91/263/EEC Articles 4c, 4d, 4e and 4f. Articles 4a and 4b are subject to proof of conformity outside of the scope of this TBR and, therefore, are not covered by this TBR. Telephony for TFTS is not a justified case and therfore, there are no requirements on voice quality in relation to Article 4g of the TTE Directive. Certain aspects of EMC performance are the subject of normal aircraft eqipment certification and are specified in Eurocae ED14C (RTCA-DO160C). The applicable test categories are specified in ARINC Characteristics 752. It should be recognized that TFTS mobile stations are airborne equipment and that they are also subject  to a separate certification process for aircraft.

The objective of this I-ETS is to ensure interworking between Terminal Equipment (TE) via the public network. This I-ETS applies in conjunction with the general requirements for PSTN access contained in ETS 300 001 [1]. The requirements of this I-ETS are additional to those for connection to the two-wire interface of the PSTN specified in ETS 300 001 [1]. The requirements of this I-ETS provide real-time (live) two-way speech of a quality consistent with the ITU-T (CCITT) P-series of  Recommendations. The testing specification for analogue handset telephony is specified in I-ETS 300 480 [2]. This I-ETS is applicable both to handset telephony terminals and the handset telephony function of a multi-function terminal. The following functions are outside the scope of this I-ETS: -hands free or loudspeaking function; -cordless telephony; -telephony for people with audio-related impairments (e.g. telephones with additional receive amplification as an aid for the hard of hearing);  -telephony terminals designed for use in hostile environments; -key systems or Private Automatic Branch eXchange (PABX) system dependent terminals; -telephones using non-linear or time variant signal processing techniques.

The sys tem defined in this ETS provides a generic solution for a variety of f uture interactive services, through the adoption of DSM-CC User-to-Use r, Download and Object Carousel protocols, as specified in MPEG2. The interactive services are provided on systems consisting of a high bitr ate downstream channel (up to the maximum bitrate of the Broadcast cha nnel) from the Service Providers to Service consumers and low bitrate interaction channels (up to 150 kbit/s). The Broadcast Service Provide r and the Interactive Service Provider need not operate from the same location. The services are primarily digital video broadcast enhanced with interactivity. At the simplest level the Interactive channel allo ws the consumer to react by voting, to order articles displayed in the broadcast programme, to select certain programme bouquets or to choos e movies in near-video-on-demand systems. It is also possible to deliv er text, graphics, audio and still pictures (including e-mail) on-dema nd , although this may require an interactive channel with higher bitr ates. There are many possible network configurations covering the currently specified DVB broadcast options including satellite, terrestrial, cabl e, SMATV and MMDS in conjunction with PSTN, ISDN, cable and other Inte ractive channel options.

The main aim of this ETS is to provide the justification for testing of requirements that are not included in other GSM specifications. Where specific requirements are included in other GSM specifications they are not duplicated here. Mobile Stations have to perform a wide variety of functions. As a consequence most performance measurements have to be made under a set of defined conditions: where necessary, these are included in this ETS. Where necessary certain assumptions are made about the interaction times between the mobile equipment and the SIM. If the (test) SIM does not respond within the assumed time then appropriate allowances shall be made. Additionally, it is intended that this ETS should contain sufficient requirements to enable some undefined network timers in TS GSM 04.08 to be calculated. "

These requirements apply to terminals for Phase 2 of the public land mobile radio service, operating in the 900 MHz band with a channel separation of 200 kHz, utilising constant envelope modulation and carrying traffic channels according to the Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) principle. This TBR specifies the requirements for GSM Telephony (speech) for the GSM900 version of the Global System for Mobile communications (GSM). For each test purpose and its corresponding conformance requirement, a reference is given to ETS 300 607-1 (GSM 11.10-1) [2]. The requirements apply to speech transmission. The measurement uncertainty is handled, as described in ETS 300 607-1 (GSM 11.10-1) [2]. This TBR covers the essential requirements of the Terminal Directive 91/263/EEC [1] Article 4g. Articles 4d, 4e, and 4f are covered by TBR 19. The Terminal Directive 91/263/EEC Articles 4a and 4b are covered by other directives, and, therefore, not by this TBR. In this TBR, there are no Electromagnetic Compatibility technical requirements in terms of the Terminal Directive 91/263/EEC, Article 4c. NOTE: Technical Requirements for EMC performance and testing of the equipment are covered by the relevant standards applicable to the EMC Directive 89/336/EEC, Annex A. Terminal equipment may be subject to additional requirements in other Common Technical Regulations (CTR) depending on the equipments functionality. ETS 300 607-1 (GSM 11.10-1) [2] constitutes the conformance test suite for GSM. The verification of the conformance requirements in this TBR is based on the tests described in this ref rence. The set of requirements in ETS 300 607-1 (GSM 11.10-1) [2] and the set of requirements in this TBR need not be identical. Some requirements only apply to specific types of mobile station (e.g. data tests only apply to mobile stations with a data facility). The TBR also indicates the specific test which shall be carried out for each mobile station type. An active accessory is covered by this TBR if it modifies the terminal performance in an aspect which affects conformance to essential requirements. NOTE: Only active devices are subject to this TBR. Accessories may be tested with specific terminals, and either approved for use with those terminals only, or may possibly be approved for use with a wider range of terminals, depending on the nature and effect of the accessory.

In this ETS some relaxations are introduced for GSM 900 mobile stations which fulfil the following conditions: - pertain to power class 4 or 5 (see section 4.1.1); - have a total weight less than 200 g (excluding battery); - have a volume less than 500 cm3 (excluding battery).  In this standard these mobile stations are referred to as small MS. Mobile stations may operate on more than one of the frequency bands specified in section 2. These mobile stations, defined in GSM 02.06, are refered to as Multi band mobile stations in this standard. Multi band mobile stations shall meet all requiremwnts for each of the bands supported. The relaxation on GSM 900 for a small MS are also va0id for a multi band MS if it complies with the definition of a small MS. The RF characteristics of repeaters are defined in Annex E of this ETS. Annex D and E are the only sections of this ETS applicable to repeaters. Annex E does not apply to the MS or BSS. "

The purpose of the handover procedures, as described in this specification,  are to ensure that the connection to the MS is maintained as it moves from one BSS area to another. This specification considers the following two cases: i) Handover between Base Stations connected to the same MSC,  this is termed an Intra-MSC handover.  ii) Handover between Base Stations connected to different MSCs, this is termed an Inter-MSC handover.  This category can be sub-divided into three further procedures:  a) the Basic Inter-MSC Handover procedure, where the MS is handed over from a controlling MSC (MSC-A) to another MSC (MSC-B);  b) the Subsequent Inter-MSC Handover procedure, where the MS is handed over from MSC-B to a third MSC (MSC-B );  c) the Subsequent Inter-MSC handback, where the MS is handed back from MSC-B to MSC-A.  In both cases i) and ii) the same procedures as defined in the TS GSM 08.08 and the TS GSM 04.08 shall be used on the A-interface and on the Radio Interface, respectively.  In case ii) the handover procedures shall transport the A-interface messages between MSC-A and MSC-B described in the Mobile Application Part (MAP), Technical Specification GSM 09.02.  The split in functionality between the BSS and MSC is described in the GSM 08 series of Technical Specifications. The interworking between the GSM 09.02 protocol and the GSM 08.08 protocol is described in the GSM 09.10 Technical Specification. Handovers which take place on the same MSC are termed Intra-MSC handovers; this includes both Inter-BSS and Intra-BSS handovers. This technical specification also covers the requirements for directed retry and the handover without a circuit conneMtion between MSC-A and MSC-B.  This technical specification does not consider the case of handovers between radio channels on the same BSS (Intra-BSS handover) or the handover of packet radio services. Inter-MSC hand-over  imposes a few limitations  on the system. After inter-MSC hand-over: - call re-establishment is not supported. The list of GSM 08.08 features supported during and after Inter-MSC handover is given in TS GSM 09.08. In the Inter-MSC handover case, the interworking between a Phase 1 BSSMAP protocol possibly used by one MSC and the Phase 2 BSSMAP protocol used in the Phase 2 MAP protocol on the E-interface is performed by this MSC. NOTE: The message primitive names used in the SDL diagrams and message flows in this technical specification do not represent the actual messages specified in the GSM 04 and GSM 08 series or the services specified in the GSM 09 series of technical specifications.

Clause 2 defines a binary protocol (Block Mode). The protocol includ es error protection and is suitable for use where the link may not be completely reliable. It will be of particular use where control of rem ote devices is required. Efficient transfer of binary encoded user dat a is possible. Clause 3 defines a character-based interfaced based on AT commands ( Text Mode). This mode is suitable for unintelligent terminals or ter minal emulators, and for application software built on command structu res like those defined in V.25ter. Some of the commands defined in cla use 3 will also be useful for implementations of clause 2 and/or claus e 4, for example enabling an indication of incoming SMS messages. Clause 4 defines a character-based interface with hex-encoded binary t ransfer of message blocks (PDU Mode). This mode is suitable for soft ware drivers based on AT command structures which do not understand th e content of the message blocks and can only pass them between the MT and upper level software resident in the TE. In all three modes, the terminal is considered to be in control for SM S/CBS transactions. This specification considers the mobile termination to be a single ent ity. Other GSM Technical Specifications describe the split of function ality between the mobile equipment and SIM. The three modes referred to above, are represented in figure 0.1/GSM 07.05. The Block mode is a self contained mode in its own right, and when e ntered, control will remain within that mode until the procedures to e oit the mode are executed, after which control is returned to the V.25 ter command state or on-line command state.

Essential conformance requirements are those which are required: a)	to ensure compatibility between the radio channels in the same cell ; b)	to ensure compatibility between cells, both co-ordinated and uncoor dinated; c)	to ensure compatibility with existing systems in the same or adjace nt frequency bands; d)	to verify the important aspects of the transmission quality of the system. Essential conformance requirements are sufficient to verify the perfor mance of the equipment for radio type approval purposes, in countries where this is applicable. Complete conformance requirements may be tested to verify all aspects of the performance of a BSS. These requirements are intended to be use d by manufacturers and operators to allow conformance and acceptance t esting to be performed in a consistent manner; the tests to be perform ed should be agreed between the parties. In some tests there are separate requirements for micro-BTS and BTS. I f there is no separate requirement for a micro-BTS, the requirements f or the BTS apply to a micro-BTS.

A stage one description does not exist because this service is not vis ible to the service subscribers and users.  This stage two identifies the functional Capabilities and information flows needed to support th e service. The signalling system protocols and switching functions nee ded to implement this service are defined in the relevant specificatio ns. Interworking with other networks (e.g. PSTN) needs the presence of spe cific functions associated with the MSC, known as interworking functio ns (IWF). The IWFs depend on the type of network with which it is desi red to interconnect and the type of service desired. A Shared Inter Working Function is a network function that may be used by any MSC in the same PLMN to provide interworking for a data/fax ca ll. Whereas an IWF can only be used by its MSC, the SIWF can be used b y several other network nodes e.g. any MSC within the same PLMN.  SIWF is applied to data services in GSM phase 2 and GSM phase 2+ (as defi ned in GSM 02.02, GSM 02.03 and GSM 02.34). The usage of a SIWF requires no additional manipulation at the MS. There is an interest to have a Shared  Interworking Function (SIWF) fo r the following reasons: - possibility to  fabricate/obtain  the specific functionality needed for data services  in areas where data traffic is expected to be low, - handling of data calls in case of local overload of the data traffic , - quick introduction and roll-out of new data services.

The CAMEL feature is applicable to mobile originated and mobile termin ated call related activities. The mechanism described addresses especially the need for information exchange among the VPLMN, HPLMN and the CAMEL Service Environment (CSE ) for support of such operator specific services. Any user procedures for operator specific services are outside the scope of this standard. The specification of operator specific services in HPLMN are outside t he scope of this standard. This specification describes only the inter actions between the VPLMN, HPLMN, IPLMN and the CSE. "

In the case of BSSs where the speech transcoder is located remotely in the Base Station Controller (BSC), the implementation of the interfac es between the DTX Handlers and the Radio Subsystem (RSS) as described in this ETS together with all their flags is mandatory, being a part of the A bis  interface as described in GSM 08.60. In this case the va rious flags also serve to avoid additional delays. The DTX functions described in this ETS are mandatory for implementati on in all GSM MSs.

The use of this tra nscoding scheme for other applications has not been considered. In GSM 06.01, a reference configuration for the speech transmission ch ain of the digital cellular telecommunications system is shown. Accord ing to this reference configuration, the speech encoder takes its inpu t as a 13 bit uniform PCM signal either from the audio part of the mob ile station or on the network side, from the PSTN via an 8 bit/A-law t o 13 bit uniform PCM conversion. The encoded speech at the output of t he speech encoder is delivered to a channel encoder unit which is spec ified in GSM 05.03. In the receive direction, the inverse operations t ake place. This ETS describes the detailed mapping between input blocks of 160 sp eech samples in 13 bit uniform PCM format to encoded blocks of 260 bit s and from encoded blocks of 260 bits to output blocks of 160 reconstr ucted speech samples.  The sampling rate is 8000 sample/s leading to a n average bit rate for the encoded bit stream of 13 kbit/s. The coding scheme is the so-called Regular Pulse Excitation - Long Term predicti on - Linear Predictive Coder, here-after referred to as RPE-LTP. This ETS also specifies the conversion between A-law PCM and 13 bit un iform PCM. Performance requirements for the audio input and output par ts are included only to the extent that they affect the transcoder per formance. The ETS also describes the codec down to the bit level, thus enabling the verification of compliance to the ETS to a high degree o f confidence by use of a set of digital test sequences. These test seq uenc s are described and are included in this ETS on diskette. "

The set of fixed equipment accessed from the MSC through one particula r instance of the interface will be later referred to as a Base Statio n System (BSS). A BSS ensures the coverage of n cells, where n can be 1 or more. The function of a BSS may be further subdivided into a control functio n, performed by one Base Station Controller (BSC) and a transceiving f unction, performed by n Base Transceiver Station equipments (BTS), o ne for each cell. However, the study of such a split is outside the sc ope of the 08.0x series of Technical Specifications, where the BSS wil l be considered as a whole. The BSS-MSC interface defined in the GSM 08 series of Technical Specif ications is designed to support a wide range of possible architectures on both sides. Characteristics like the physical location of the tran scoders/rate adaptation inside the BSS (either integrated into the tra nsceivers or very near to the MSC) or the use of traffic or signalling concentration at either side are left to the operators choice. Annex A to this Technical Specification contains guidance information concer ning the use of remote mobile switching units, which for the purposes of this specification are considered as part of the MSC. Direct connection between two BSSs is not supported by this interface. This interface is based on the use of 1 or more 2 048 kbit/s digital t ransmission system interfaces. Each 2 048 kbit/s interface provides 31 *64 kbit/s channels which can be used for traffic or signalling as the operator requires. The signalling is layured, terminology similar to that in the OSI refe rence model is used in this series, however the layers referred to are not identical to the equivalently named layer in the OSI model. This interface is defined at the boundary of the MSC and has a per cha nnel bit rate of 64 kbit/s, but the net radio path traffic channel is at a rate of less than 16 kbit/s. A transcoder or rate adapter functio n is thus needed for the rate conversion. The interface is designed su ch that the transcoding or rate adaptation function may be geographica lly situated at either the MSC site or the BSS site, however the trans coder is considered to be part of the BSS. The interface has been designed around the aims of GSM 08.01 allowing each component and the system as a whole to evolve. "

The CAMEL feature is applicable to mobile originated activity, to terminated traffic, and to the ability of the HPLMN to interrogate or to instruct the VPLMN or IPLMN at any time. A PLMN supporting CAMEL shall also support at least Optimal routing for conditionally forwarded calls. In this specification, the CAMEL service environment (CSE) is treated as being part of the HPLMN. The regulatory environment in some countries may require the possibility that the CSE and the HPLMN are controlled by different operators, and the CSE and HLPMN are therefore distinct entities. In the first phase the CAMEL feature supports: -	mobile originated calls -	mobile terminating calls -	any time interrogation  The mechanism described addresses especially the need for information exchange among the VPLMN or IPLMN and the HPLMN for support of such operator specific services. Any user procedures for the control of operator specific services are outside the scope of this standard. Subscribers who have subscribed to operator specific services and in turn need the functional support of the CAMEL feature shall be marked in the HPLMN and VPLMN. In case a subscriber is marked to need such support, the appropriate procedures which provide the necessary information to the VPLMN or to the HPLMN are invoked. It is possible for the HPLMN to instruct the VPLMN or IPLMN to interact with a GSM Service Control Function which is logically distinct from both the HPLMN and VPLMN, but eontrolled by the HPLMN. The CAMEL feature is a network feature and not a supplementary service. It is a tool to help the network operator to provide the subscribers with the operator specific services even when roaming outside the HPLMN. The specification of operator specific services in HPLMN are outside the scope of this standard. This specification describes only the interface between the VPLMN or IPLMN and HPLMN (including procedures to be supported in the VPLMN/IPLMN). "

The main aim of this ETS is to provide the justification for testing of requirements that are not included in other GSM specifications. Where specific requirements are included in other GSM specifications they are not duplicated here. Mobile Stations have to perform a wide variety of functions.

The commands described in this ETS may be observed on the link between the TE and the TA. However, most of the commands retrieve information about the ME, not about the TA. "

Section 2 defines a binary protocol (Block Mode). The protocol includes error protection and is suitable for use where the link may not be completely reliable. It will be of particular use where control of remote devices is required. Efficient transfer of binary encoded user data is possible. Section 3 defines a character-based interfaced based on AT commands (Text Mode). This mode is suitable for unintelligent terminals or terminal emulators, and for application software built on command structures like those defined in V.25ter. Some of the commands defined in Section 3 will also be useful for implementations of Section 2 and/or Section 4, for example enabling an indication of incoming SMS messages. Section 4 defines a character-based interface with hex-encoded binary transfer of message blocks (PDU Mode). This mode is suitable for software drivers based on AT command structures which do not understand the content of the message blocks and can only pass them between the MT and upper level software resident in the TE. In all three modes, the terminal is considered to be in control for SMS/CBS transactions. This specification considers the mobile termination to be a single entity.

In GSM EFR 06.51, a reference configuration for the speech transmission chain of the GSM EFR system is shown. According to this reference configuration, the speech encoder takes its input as a 13-bit uniform PCM signal either from the audio part of the Mobile Station or on the network side, from the PSTN via an 8-bit/A-law to 13-bit uniform PCM conversion. The encoded speech at the output of the speech encoder is delivered to a channel encoder unit which is specified in GSM 05.03. In the receive direction, the inverse operations take place.  This draft European Technical Specification (ETS) describes the detailed mapping between input blocks of 160 speech samples in 13-bit uniform PCM format to encoded blocks of 260 bits and from encoded blocks of 260 bits to output blocks of 160 reconstructed speech samples. The sampling rate is 8000 sample/s leading to a bit rate for the encoded bit stream of 13 kbit/s. The coding scheme is the so-called Algebraic Code Excited Linear Prediction Coder, here-after referred to as ACELP.  This ETS also specifies the conversion between A-law PCM and 13-bit uniform PCM. Performance requirements for the audio input and output parts are included only to the extent that they affect the transcoder performance. This part also describes the codec down to the bit level, thus enabling the verification of compliance to the part to a high degree of confidence by use of a set of digital test sequences. These test sequences are also described and are available on disks. "

Clause 2 defines a binary protocol (Block Mode). The protocol includ es error protection and is suitable for use where the link may not be completely reliable. It will be of particular use where control of rem ote devices is required. Efficient transfer of binary encoded user dat a is possible. Clause 3 defines a character-based interfaced based on AT commands ( Text Mode). This mode is suitable for unintelligent terminals or ter minal emulators, and for application software built on command structu res like those defined in V.25ter. Some of the commands defined in cla use 3 will also be useful for implementations of clause 2 and/or claus e 4, for example enabling an indication of incoming SMS messages. Clause 4 defines a character-based interface with hex-encoded binary t ransfer of message blocks (PDU Mode). This mode is suitable for soft ware drivers based on AT command structures which do not understand th e content of the message blocks and can only pass them between the MT and upper level software resident in the TE. In all three modes, the terminal is considered to be in control for SM S/CBS transactions. This specification considers the mobile termination to be a single ent ity. Other GSM Technical Specifications describe the split of function ality between the mobile equipment and SIM. The three modes referred to above, are represented in figure 0.1/GSM 07.05. The Block mode is a self contained mode in its own right, and when e ntered, control will remain within that mode until the procedures to e oit the mode are executed, after which control is returned to the V.25 ter command state or on-line command state. The Text and PDU modes are not in themselves V.25ter states but ar e simply sets of commands which will operate in either the V.25ter co mmand state or on-line command state. The Text and PDU modes ar e transitory states and after each operation, control is automatically returned to the V.25ter command state or on-line command state. W hilst in the V.25ter command state, the MS is available to handle inco ming and outgoing calls such as Data or Facsimile. "

This ETS with methods of test is produced as a draft ETS. A subset of the tests is referenced in the GSM Common Technical Regulations (CTRs) and is used for regulatory conformance testing according to the EEC procedures for Telecommunications Terminal Equipment (TTE) type approval (EC Directive 91/263/EEC; also known as the Terminal Directive or Second Phase Directive). The remaining tests can be used to verify conformance with the GSM core technical specifications for those requirements that are not considered essential in the sense of the EC Directive 91/263/EEC (Article 4).

These requirements apply to terminals for Phase 2 of the public land mobile radio service, operating in: -	the DCS 1 800 band; or -	both in the DCS 1 800 band and the GSM 900 MHz band. with a channel separation of 200 kHz, utilizing constant envelope modu lation and carrying traffic channels according to the Time Division Mu ltiple Access (TDMA) principle. This TBR specifies the access requirements for terminals as stated abo ve implementing the GSM standard. For each test purpose and its corresponding conformance requirement, a reference is given to ETS 300 607-1 (GSM 11.10-1) [2]. The requiremen ts apply to speech transmission. The measurement uncertainty is handled, as described in ETS 300 607-1 (GSM 11.10) [2]. This TBR covers the essential requirements of the Terminal Directive 9 1/263/EEC [1] Article 4g. Articles 4d, 4e, and 4f are covered by TBR 3 1. The Terminal Directive 91/263/EEC Articles 4a and 4b are covered by ot her directives, and, therefore, not by this TBR. In this TBR, there are no Electromagnetic Compatibility technical requ irements in terms of the Terminal Directive 91/263/EEC, Article 4c. NOTE:	Technical Requirements for EMC performance and testing of the eq uipment are covered by the relevant standards applicable to the EMC Di rective 89/336/EEC, annex A. Terminal equipment may be subject to additional requirements in other Common Technical Regulations (CTR) depending on the equipments functio nality.

The set of fixed equipment accessed from the MSC through one particula r instance of the interface will be later referred to as a Base Statio n System (BSS). A BSS ensures the coverage of n cells, where n can be 1 or more. The function of a BSS may be further subdivided into a control functio n, performed by one Base Station Controller (BSC) and a transceiving f unction, performed by n Base Transceiver Station equipments (BTS), o ne for each cell. However, the study of such a split is outside the sc ope of the 08.0x series of Technical Specifications, where the BSS wil l be considered as a whole. The BSS-MSC interface defined in the GSM 08 series of Technical Specif ications is designed to support a wide range of possible architectures on both sides. Characteristics like the physical location of the tran scoders/rate adaptation inside the BSS (either integrated into the tra nsceivers or very near to the MSC) or the use of traffic or signalling concentration at either side are left to the operators choice. Annex A to this Technical Specification contains guidance information concer ning the use of remote mobile switching units, which for the purposes of this specification are considered as part of the MSC. Direct connection between two BSSs is not supported by this interface. This interface is based on the use of 1 or more 2 048 kbit/s digital t ransmission system interfaces. Each 2 048 kbit/s interface provides 31 *64 kbit/s channels which can be used for traffic or signalling as the operator requires. The signalling is layured, terminology similar to that in the OSI refe rence model is used in this series, however the layers referred to are not identical to the equivalently named layer in the OSI model. This interface is defined at the boundary of the MSC and has a per cha nnel bit rate of 64 kbit/s, but the net radio path traffic channel is at a rate of less than 16 kbit/s. A transcoder or rate adapter functio n is thus needed for the rate conversion. The interface is designed su ch that the transcoding or rate adaptation function may be geographica lly situated at either the MSC site or the BSS site, however the trans coder is considered to be part of the BSS. The interface has been designed around the aims of GSM 08.01 allowing each component and the system as a whole to evolve. "

Clause 2 defines a binary protocol (Block Mode). The protocol includ es error protection and is suitable for use where the link may not be completely reliable. It will be of particular use where control of rem ote devices is required. Efficient transfer of binary encoded user dat a is possible. Clause 3 defines a character-based interfaced based on AT commands ( Text Mode). This mode is suitable for unintelligent terminals or ter minal emulators, and for application software built on command structu res like those defined in V.25ter. Some of the commands defined in cla use 3 will also be useful for implementations of clause 2 and/or claus e 4, for example enabling an indication of incoming SMS messages. Clause 4 defines a character-based interface with hex-encoded binary t ransfer of message blocks (PDU Mode). This mode is suitable for soft ware drivers based on AT command structures which do not understand th e content of the message blocks and can only pass them between the MT and upper level software resident in the TE. In all three modes, the terminal is considered to be in control for SM S/CBS transactions. This specification considers the mobile termination to be a single ent ity. Other GSM Technical Specifications describe the split of function ality between the mobile equipment and SIM. The three modes referred to above, are represented in figure 0.1/GSM 07.05. The Block mode is a self contained mode in its own right, and when e ntered, control will remain within that mode until the procedures to e oit the mode are executed, after which control is returned to the V.25 ter command state or on-line command state. The Text and PDU modes are not in themselves V.25ter states but ar e simply sets of commands which will operate in either the V.25ter co mmand state or on-line command state.

This ETS with methods of test is produced as a draft ETS. A subset of the tests is referenced in the GSM Common Technical Regulations (CTRs) and is used for regulatory conformance testing according to the EEC procedures for Telecommunications Terminal Equipment (TTE) type approval (EC Directive 91/263/EEC; also known as the Terminal Directive or Second Phase Directive). The remaining tests can be used to verify conformance with the GSM core technical specifications for those requirements that are not considered essential in the sense of the EC Directive 91/263/EEC (Article 4). This ETS covers the minimum characteristics considered necessary in order to provide sufficient performance for mobile equipment and to prevent interference to other services or to other users, and to the PLMNs. It does not necessarily include all the characteristics which may be required by a user or subscriber, nor does it necessarily represent the optimum performance achievable. It applies to the public land mobile radio service in the GSM900 and DCS1800 systems, using constant envelope modulation and operating on radio frequencies in the 900 and 1800 MHz bands respectively with a channel separation of 200 kHz and carrying 8 full rate channels or 16 half rate channels per carrier according to the TDMA principle.

It allows the same consumer Integrated Receiver Decoder (IRD) to be used for either service, when used with a Low Noise Block (LNB) down-converter for the appropriate frequency band. The frequency band 40,5 to 42,5 GHz has been harmonised within CEPT under Recommendation T/R 52-01.  The System however, is applicable to other frequency bands above 10 GHz. The System uses Quaternary Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) modulation and concatenated error protection strategy based on a convolutional code and shortened Reed-Solomon (RS) code. The System is suitable for use on different MVDS transmitter bandwidths. Compatibility with Moving Pictures Experts Group-2 (MPEG-2) coded TV services (see ISO/IEC IS 13818-1), with a transmission structure synchronous with the packet multiplex, is provided.

Section 2 defines a binary protocol (Block Mode). The protocol includes error protection and is suitable for use where the link may not be completely reliable. It will be of particular use where control of remote devices is required. Efficient transfer of binary encoded user data is possible. Section 3 defines a character-based interfaced based on AT commands (Text Mode). This mode is suitable for unintelligent terminals or terminal emulators, and for application software built on command structures like those defined in V.25ter. Some of the commands defined in Section 3 will also be useful for implementations of Section 2 and/or Section 4, for example enabling an indication of incoming SMS messages. Section 4 defines a character-based interface with hex-encoded binary transfer of message blocks (PDU Mode). This mode is suitable for software drivers based on AT command structures which do not understand the content of the message blocks and can only pass them between the MT and upper level software resident in the TE. In all three modes, the terminal is considered to be in control for SMS/CBS transactions. This specification considers the mobile termination to be a single entity. Other GSM Technical Specifications describe the split of functionality between the mobile equipment and SIM. "

These requirements apply to terminals for Phase 2 of the public land mobile radio service, operating in the 900 MHz band with a channel separation of 200 kHz, utilising constant envelope modulation and carrying traffic channels according to the Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) principle. This TBR specifies the terminal equipment access requirements for the GSM 900 version of the Global System for Mobile communications (GSM). For each test purpose and its corresponding conformance requirement, a reference is given to the test method in ETS 300 607-1 (GSM 11.10-1) [2]. The requirements apply at the air interface and the Subscriber Identity Module - Mobile Equipment interface for the access requirements, which may be stimulated to perform the tests by additional equipment if necessary. The measurement uncertainty is described in ETS 300 607-1 (GSM 11.10-1) [2]. This TBR covers the essential requirements of the Terminal Directive 91/263/EEC [1] Articles 4d, 4e, 4f. Non access related aspects of speech telephony, where Article 4g has been applied, are covered by TBR 20. The Terminal Directive 91/263/EEC [1] Articles 4a and 4b are covered by other directives, and, therefore, not by this TBR. In this TBR, there are no Electromagnetic Compatibility technical requirements in terms of the Terminal Directive 91/263/EEC [1], Article 4c. NOTE: Technical Requirements for EMC performance and testing of the equipment are covered by the relevant standards applicable to the EMC Directive 89/336/EEC, Annex A. Terminal equipment may be subject to additional requirements in other CommonbTechnical Regulations (CTR) depending on the equipments functionality. ETS 300 607-1 (GSM 11.10-1) [2] constitutes the conformance test suite for GSM. The verification of the conformance requirements in this TBR is based on the tests described in this reference. The set of requirements in ETS 300 607-1 (GSM 11.10-1) [2] and the set of requirements in this TBR need not be identical. Some requirements only apply to specific types of mobile station (e.g. data tests only apply to mobile stations with a data facility). The TBR also indicates the specific test which should be carried out for each mobile station type. An active accessory is covered by this TBR if it modifies the terminal performance in an aspect which affects conformance to essential requirements. NOTE: Only active devices are subject to this TBR. Accessories may be tested with specific terminals, and either approved for use with those terminals only, or may possibly be approved for use with a wider range of terminals, depending on the nature and effect of the accessory.

The purpose of the handover procedures, as described in this specification,  are to ensure that the connection to the MS is maintained as it moves from one BSS area to another. This specification considers the following two cases: i) Handover between Base Stations connected to the same MSC,  this is termed an Intra-MSC handover.  ii) Handover between Base Stations connected to different MSCs, this is termed an Inter-MSC handover.  This category can be sub-divided into three further procedures:  a) the Basic Inter-MSC Handover procedure, where the MS is handed over from a controlling MSC (MSC-A) to another MSC (MSC-B);  b) the Subsequent Inter-MSC Handover procedure, where the MS is handed over from MSC-B to a third MSC (MSC-B );  c) the Subsequent Inter-MSC handback, where the MS is handed back from MSC-B to MSC-A.  In both cases i) and ii) the same procedures as defined in the TS GSM 08.08 and the TS GSM 04.08 shall be used on the A-interface and on the Radio Interface, respectively.  In case ii) the handover procedures shall transport the A-interface messages between MSC-A and MSC-B described in the Mobile Application Part (MAP), Technical Specification GSM 09.02.  The split in functionality between the BSS and MSC is described in the GSM 08 series of Technical Specifications. The interworking between the GSM 09.02 protocol and the GSM 08.08 protocol is described in the GSM 09.10 Technical Specification. Handovers which take place on the same MSC are termed Intra-MSC handovers; this includes both Inter-BSS and Intra-BSS handovers. This technical specification also covers the requirements for directed retry ani the handover without a circuit connection between MSC-A and MSC-B.  This technical specification does not consider the case of handovers between radio channels on the same BSS (Intra-BSS handover) or the handover of packet radio services. Inter-MSC hand-over  imposes a few limitations  on the system. After inter-MSC hand-over: - call re-establishment is not supported. The list of GSM 08.08 features supported during and after Inter-MSC handover is given in TS GSM 09.08. In the Inter-MSC handover case, the interworking between a Phase 1 BSSMAP protocol possibly used by one MSC and the Phase 2 BSSMAP protocol used in the Phase 2 MAP protocol on the E-interface is performed by this MSC. NOTE: The message primitive names used in the SDL diagrams and message flows in this technical specification do not represent the actual messages specified in the GSM 04 and GSM 08 series or the services specified in the GSM 09 series of technical specifications.  The primitive names are only intended to be indicative of their use in this document. "

Section 2 defines a binary protocol (Block Mode). The protocol includes error protection and is suitable for use where the link may not be completely reliable. It will be of particular use where control of remote devices is required. Efficient transfer of binary encoded user data is possible. Section 3 defines a character-based interfaced based on AT commands (Text Mode). This mode is suitable for unintelligent terminals or terminal emulators, and for application software built on command structures like those defined in V.25ter. Some of the commands defined in Section 3 will also be useful for implementations of Section 2 and/or Section 4, for example enabling an indication of incoming SMS messages. Section 4 defines a character-based interface with hex-encoded binary transfer of message blocks (PDU Mode). This mode is suitable for software drivers based on AT command structures which do not understand the content of the message blocks and can only pass them between the MT and upper level software resident in the TE. In all three modes, the terminal is considered to be in control for SMS/CBS transactions. This specification considers the mobile termination to be a single entity. Other GSM Technical Specifications describe the split of functionality between the mobile equipment and SIM. "

This ETS outlines how the requirements of the GSM 02 series Technical Specifications (especially GSM 02.11) on idle mode operation shall be implemented. Further details are given in GSM 04.08 and GSM 05.08. Clause 2 of this ETS gives a general description of the idle mode process. Clause 3 outlines the main requirements and technical solutions of those requirements. Clause 4 describes the processes used in idle mode. There is inevitably some overlap between these clauses. "

Requirements are defined for two categories of parameters: - those that are required to provide compatibility between the radio channels, connected either to separate or common antennas, that are used in the system. This category also includes parameters providing compatibility with existing systems in the same or adjacent frequency bands.  - those that define the transmission quality of the system.  This ETS defines RF characteristics for the Mobile Station (MS) and Base Station System (BSS). The BSS will contain either Base Transceiver Stations (BTS) or microcell base transceiver stations (micro-BTS). The precise measurement methods are specified in GSM 11.10 and 11.20. Unless otherwise stated, the requirements defined in this ETS apply to the full range of environmental conditions specified for the equipment (see Annex D). In this ETS some relaxations are introduced for GSM 900 mobile stations which fulfil the following conditions: - pertain to power class 4 or 5 (see section 4.1.1); - have a total weight less than 200 g (excluding battery); - have a volume less than 500 cm3 (excluding battery).  In this standard these mobile stations are referred to as small MS. Mobile stations may operate on more than one of the frequency bands specified in section 2. These mobile stations, defined in GSM 02.06, are refered to as Multi band mobile stations in this standard. Multi band mobile stations shall meet all requiremwnts for each of the bands supported. The relaxation on GSM 900 for a small MS are also va0id for a multi band MS if it complies with the definition of a small MS. The RF characteristics of repeaters are defined in Annex E of this ETS. Annex D and E are the only sections of this ETS applicable to repeaters. Annex E does not apply to the MS or BSS. "

SIM Application Toolkit is a set of commands and procedures for use during the network operation phase of GSM, in addition to those define in GSM 11.11 [14]. Specifying the interface is to ensure interoperability between a SIM and an ME independently of the respective manufacturers and operators. The concept of a split of the Mobile Station (MS) into these elements as well as the distinction between the GSM network operation phase, which is also called GSM operations, and the administrative management phase are described in the Technical Specification GSM 02.17 [3]. This Technical Specification defines: - the commands;  - the application protocol;  - the mandatory requirements on the SIM and ME for each procedure.  Unless otherwise stated, references to GSM also apply to DCS 1800. This standard does not specify any aspects related to the administrative management phase.  Any internal technical realisation o either the SIM or the ME are only specified where these reflect over the interface.

This ETS also describes the methodology to be employed in the definition of the standardization activity and the scale of the results which are expected to be achieved. PLMN management is described in terms of the objectives for the Operator enterprise. Relationships exist between network management functionality and functionality required to support the enterprise model. While the definition of the enterprise model is outside of the scope of this series of ETSs, an understanding of the requirements is necessary so as to provide the underlying network management procedures.

It defines the administration of measurement schedules, the generation of measurement results in the Network Elements (NEs) and the transfer of these results to the Operations System (OS). It also describes how the various requirements can be modelled as part of the generic PLMN information model. A set of measurements available for collection by NEs are described in annex B, effort has been made to ensure consistency in the definition of measurements between different NEs. The following is beyond the scope ETS, and therefore this ETS does not describe: - how the data, once accumulated and collected, could or should be processed, stored, or presented to an end user;  - the information which may be obtained through the collection and processing of call or event related records which have been produced by the NEs primarily for the purpose of raising bills and other charges.  The management requirements have been derived from existing telecommunications operations experience. The management definitions were then derived from other standardisation work so as to minimise the re-invention factor. References are given as appropriate. The objectives of this standardisation are: to normalise the description of each measurement; and to produce a common description of the management technique for result accumulation and transmission across a management interface. The normalisation is intended to result in comparability of measurement data produced in a multi-vendor PLMN. As far as possible, existing standardisation in the area of performanre management has been re-used and enhanced where particular requirements, peculiar to the mobile telephony environment, have been recognised. Field of application This ETS considers all aspects of performance management for a PLMN and its NEs defined in the GSM core Technical Specifications. However, only those aspects which are GSM specific and particular to PLMN operation are included in this ETS. Other performance measurement aspects of described NEs and performance measurement aspects of NEs not described by the GSM core Technical Specifications are included for information purposes in annex E or may be found in referenced documents.

The purpose of the handover procedures, as described in this specification,  are to ensure that the connection to the MS is maintained as it moves from one BSS area to another. This specification considers the following two cases: i) Handover between Base Stations connected to the same MSC,  this is termed an Intra-MSC handover.  ii) Handover between Base Stations connected to different MSCs, this is termed an Inter-MSC handover.  This category can be sub-divided into three further procedures:  a) the Basic Inter-MSC Handover procedure, where the MS is handed over from a controlling MSC (MSC-A) to another MSC (MSC-B);  b) the Subsequent Inter-MSC Handover procedure, where the MS is handed over from MSC-B to a third MSC (MSC-B );  c) the Subsequent Inter-MSC handback, where the MS is handed back from MSC-B to MSC-A.  In both cases i) and ii) the same procedures as defined in the TS GSM 08.08 and the TS GSM 04.08 shall be used on the A-interface and on the Radio Interface, respectively.  In case ii) the handover procedures shall transport the A-interface messages between MSC-A and MSC-B described in the Mobile Application Part (MAP), Technical Specification GSM 09.02.  The split in functionality between the BSS and MSC is described in the GSM 08 series of Technical Specifications. The interworking between the GSM 09.02 protocol and the GSM 08.08 protocol is described in the GSM 09.10 Technical Specification. Handovers which take place on the same MSC are termed Intra-MSC handovers; this includes both Inter-BSS and Intra-BSS handovers. This technical specification also covers the requirements for directed retry ani the handover without a circuit connection between MSC-A and MSC-B.  This technical specification does not consider the case of handovers between radio channels on the same BSS (Intra-BSS handover) or the handover of packet radio services. Inter-MSC hand-over  imposes a few limitations  on the system. After inter-MSC hand-over: - call re-establishment is not supported. The list of GSM 08.08 features supported during and after Inter-MSC handover is given in TS GSM 09.08. In the Inter-MSC handover case, the interworking between a Phase 1 BSSMAP protocol possibly used by one MSC and the Phase 2 BSSMAP protocol used in the Phase 2 MAP protocol on the E-interface is performed by this MSC. NOTE: The message primitive names used in the SDL diagrams and message flows in this technical specification do not represent the actual messages specified in the GSM 04 and GSM 08 series or the services specified in the GSM 09 series of technical specifications.

The main aim of this ETS is to provide the justification for testing of requirements that are not included in other GSM specifications. Where specific requirements are included in other GSM specifications they are not duplicated here. Mobile Stations have to perform a wide variety of functions. As a consequence most performance measurements have to be made under a set of defined conditions: where necessary, these are included in this ETS. Where necessary certain assumptions are made about the interaction times between the mobile equipment and the SIM. If the (test) SIM does not respond within the assumed time then appropriate allowances shall be made. Additionally, it is intended that this ETS should contain sufficient requirements to enable some undefined network timers in TS GSM 04.08 to be calculated. "

This category also includes parameters providing compatibility with existing systems in the same or adjacent frequency bands.  - those that define the transmission quality of the system.  This ETS defines RF characteristics for the Mobile Station (MS) and Base Station System (BSS). The BSS will contain either Base Transceiver Stations (BTS) or microcell base transceiver stations (micro-BTS). The precise measurement methods are specified in GSM 11.10 and 11.20. Unless otherwise stated, the requirements defined in this ETS apply to the full range of environmental conditions specified for the equipment (see Annex D). In this ETS some relaxations are introduced for GSM 900 mobile stations which fulfil the following conditions: - pertain to power class 4 or 5 (see section 4.1.1); - have a total weight less than 200 g (excluding battery); - have a volume less than 500 cm3 (excluding battery).

This ETS with methods of test is produced as a draft ETS. A subset of the tests is referenced in the GSM Common Technical Regulations (CTRs) and is used for regulatory conformance testing according to the EEC procedures for Telecommunications Terminal Equipment (TTE) type approval (EC Directive 91/263/EEC; also known as the Terminal Directive or Second Phase Directive). The remaining tests can be used to verify conformance with the GSM core technical specifications for those requirements that are not considered essential in the sense of the EC Directive 91/263/EEC (Article 4). This ETS covers the minimum characteristics considered necessary in order to provide sufficient performance for mobile equipment and to prevent interference to other services or to other users, and to the PLMNs. It does not necessarily include all the characteristics which may be required by a user or subscriber, nor does it necessarily represent the optimum performance achievable. It applies to the public land mobile radio service in the GSM900 and DCS1800 systems, using constant envelope modulation and operating on radio frequencies in the 900 and 1800 MHz bands respectively with a channel separation of 200 kHz and carrying 8 full rate channels or 16 half rate channels per carrier according to the TDMA principle. This ETS is part of the GSM-series of technical specifications. This ETS neither replaccs any of the other GSM technical specifications or GSM related ETS, nor is it created to provide full understanding of (or parts of) the GSM900 and DCS1800 systems. This ETS lists the requirements, and provides the methods of test for testing a MS for conformance to the GSM standard. For a full description of the system, reference should be made to all the GSM technical specifications or GSM related ETSs. Clause 2 provides a complete list of the GSM technical specifications, GSM related ETSs, and ETRs, on which this conformance test specifications is based. This ETS applies to the unit which includes the hardware to establish a connection across the radio interface. If there is a difference between this conformance test ETS, and any other GSM technical specification or GSM related ETS, then the other GSM technical specification or GSM related ETS shall prevail.

When combined with ITU-T Recommendation G.652 [2] on the fibre characteristics, these figures can be used in a worst-case design for the maximum repeater section length. This approach employs worst-case values for all transmission parameters resulting in a repeater section design which guarantees attenuation and dispersion penalties between the S and R reference points which are lower the specified limits in 100 % of all cases. Studies carried out in several countries, show that a worst-case design approach can lead to significant cost penalties for long-haul systems. Recently statistical and semi-statistical approaches have been considered in designing the maximum repeater section length, taking account of the expected statistical variations in the transmission parameters of equipment and cable (e.g. cable attenuation, splice attenuation, transmitted power, etc.). These approaches are based on designing the maximum repeater section length for a high probability (e.g. 99 %) of each repeater section having an adequate system margin over the lifetime of the system. Statistical and semi-statistical approaches achieve significant cost-saving through reductions in the number of the repeaters for a long-haul system, but admit a pre determined probability of insufficient optical path allowances between reference points S and R. The cost savings are substantial for remote power feeding systems where local electrical power plant does not exist. This ETR contains definitions of the different design approaches, statistical dati forms and numerical examples for statistical design for fibre optics systems. The use of this ETR is at the discretion of the reader. "

Some requirements only apply to specific types of mobile station (e.g. data tests only apply to mobile stations with a data facility). The TBR also indicates the specific test which should be carried out for each mobile station type. An active accessory is covered by this TBR if it modifies the terminal performance in an aspect which affects conformance to essential requirements. NOTE: Only active devices are subject to this TBR. Accessories may be tested with specific terminals, and either approved for use with those terminals only, or may possibly be approved for use with a wider range of terminals, depending on the nature and effect of the accessory.

These requirements apply to terminals for Phase 2 of the public land mobile radio service, operating in the 900 MHz band with a channel separation of 200 kHz, utilising constant envelope modulation and carrying traffic channels according to the Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) principle. This TBR specifies the requirements for GSM Telephony (speech) for the GSM900 version of the Global System for Mobile communications (GSM). For each test purpose and its corresponding conformance requirement, a reference is given to ETS 300 607-1 (GSM 11.10-1) [2]. The requirements apply to speech transmission. The measurement uncertainty is handled, as described in ETS 300 607-1 (GSM 11.10-1) [2]. This TBR covers the essential requirements of the Terminal Directive 91/263/EEC [1] Article 4g. Articles 4d, 4e, and 4f are covered by TBR 19. The Terminal Directive 91/263/EEC Articles 4a and 4b are covered by other directives, and, therefore, not by this TBR. In this TBR, there are no Electromagnetic Compatibility technical requirements in terms of the Terminal Directive 91/263/EEC, Article 4c. NOTE: Technical Requirements for EMC performance and testing of the equipment are covered by the relevant standards applicable to the EMC Directive 89/336/EEC, Annex A. Terminal equipment may be subject to additional requirements in other Common Technical Regulations (CTR) depending on the equipments functionality. ETS 300 607-1 (GSM 11.10-1) [2] constitutes the conformance test suite for GSM. The verification of the conformance requirements in this TBR is based on the tests described in this ref rence. The set of requirements in ETS 300 607-1 (GSM 11.10-1) [2] and the set of requirements in this TBR need not be identical. Some requirements only apply to specific types of mobile station (e.g. data tests only apply to mobile stations with a data facility). The TBR also indicates the specific test which shall be carried out for each mobile station type. An active accessory is covered by this TBR if it modifies the terminal performance in an aspect which affects conformance to essential requirements. NOTE: Only active devices are subject to this TBR. Accessories may be tested with specific terminals, and either approved for use with those terminals only, or may possibly be approved for use with a wider range of terminals, depending on the nature and effect of the accessory.

This service has two parts - precedence and pre emption. Precedence involves assigning a priority level to a call in combination with fast call set-up. Pre-emption involves the seizing of resources, which are in use by a call of a lower precedence, by a higher level precedence call in the absence of idle resources. Pre-emption can also involve the disconnection of an on-going call of lower precedence to accept an incoming call of higher precedence. The eMLPP service is provided as a network operator s option to a domain of a network. The domain can be the whole network or a subset of the network. The eMLPP service applies to all network resources in the domain that is in common use. The eMLPP service is applicable to all mobile stations in the domain with all or some mobile stations having a respective subscription assigning precedence according to the eMLPP service. eMLPP is a supplementary service and shall be provided to a subscriber for all basic services subscribed to and for which eMLPP applies. NOTE:	It is under study whether normal GSM phase 2 mobile stations will be able to be used for this service. The service is described from the service subscriber s and user s point of view, in particular: -	the procedure for normal operation with successful outcome;  -	the action to be taken in exceptional circumstances;  -	the interaction with other GSM services and features.  This specification does not deal with the Man-Machine Interface (MMI) requirements, but makes reference to the appropriate Global System for Mobile communications (GSM) specifications. This specification is applicable to teleseruices 1x and 6x and to all bearer services used in a mobile network according to the digital cellular telecommunications system GSM if eMLPP is provided.

These requirements apply to terminals for phase 1 of the public land mobile radio service utilising constant envelope modulation, operating in the 900 MHz band with a channel separation of 200 kHz, and carrying 8 full rate traffic channels per carrier according to the Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) principle. This TBR covers the requirements for Global System for Mobile communications (GSM) access to the network. For each conformance requirement, one or more test purposes are given. For each test purpose, a single reference is given to the test method in GSM 11.10 (I-ETS 300 020-1) [2]. The requirements apply at the air interface and the SIM-ME interface for the access requirements, which may be stimulated to perform the tests by additional equipment if necessary. The measurement uncertainty is handled, as described in GSM 11.10 (I-ETS 300 020-1) [2]. This TBR covers the essential requirements of the Terminal Directive 91/263/EEC [1] Articles 4d, 4e, 4f. Non access related aspects of speech telephony, where Article 4g has been applied, are covered by TBR 9 [7]. The Terminal Directive 91/263/EEC [1] Articles 4a and 4b are covered by other directives, and, therefore, not by this TBR. In this TBR, there are no EMC technical requirements in terms of the Terminal Directive 91/263/EEC [1], Article 4c. NOTE: Technical Requirements for EMC performance and testing of the equipment are covered by the relevant standards applicable to the EMC Directive 89/336/EEC, Annex A.

These requirements apply to terminals for phase 1 of the public land mobile radio service utilising constant envelope modulation, operating in the 900 MHz band with a channel separation of 200 kHz, and carrying 8 full rate traffic channels per carrier according to the Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) principle. This TBR covers the requirements for GSM Telephony (speech). NOTE: Certain access aspects are part of TBR 5 [7]. For each conformance requirement, one or more test purposes are given. For each test purpose, a single reference is given to the test method in GSM 11.10 (I-ETS 300 020-1) [2]. The requirements apply to speech transmission. The measurement uncertainty is handled, as described in GSM 11.10 (I-ETS 300 020-1) [2]. This TBR covers the essential requirements of the Terminal Directive 91/263/EEC [1] Article 4g. Articles 4d, 4e and 4f are covered by TBR 5 [7]. The Terminal Directive 91/263/EEC [1] Articles 4a and 4b are covered by other directives, and, therefore, not by this TBR. In this TBR, there are no EMC technical requirements in terms of the Terminal Directive 91/263/EEC [1], Article 4c. NOTE: Technical Requirments for EMC performance and testing of the equipment are covered by the relevant standards applicable to the EMC Directive 89/336/EEC, Annex A. Terminal equipment may be subject to additional requirements in other Common Technical Regulations (CTR) depending on the equipments functionality. GSM 11.10 (I-ETS 300 020-1) [2] constitutes the full conformance test suite for GSM. The verification of the conformance requirements in this TBR ame based on the tests described in this reference.

SI is specified in ISO/IEC 13818-1 as Programme Specific Information (PSI). This specification complements the PSI by providing data to aid automatic tuning of IRDs, and addditional information intended for display to the user, mainly in text form. The manner of presentation of the information is not specified, and IRD manufacturers have freedom to choose appropriate presentation methods. It is expected that Electronic Programme Guides (EPG) will be a feature of Digital TV transmissions. The definition of EPG is outside the scope of the SI specification, but the data contained within the SI specified here could be used as basis for an EPG. The present specification describes Service Information (SI) for use in broadcast MPEG-2 bitstreams. The MPEG-2 System layer specifies SI which is referred to as Programme Specific Information (PSI).

For these PHs the case A/B conversion in the GSM HPLMN is necessary. CONSEQUENCES OF NON-ACCEPTANCE 1: This amendment is necessary to allow basic packet access to PH supporting only case B. For these PH exists agreement between the PLMN and the fixed network operators to signal the case B between PLMN and ISDN. If the amendment is not accepted then the interworking could be faulty and a large number of PHs could not work efficiently.

This is not correct since the SC address length is coded as the RP-Destination address specified in GSM 04.11. These addresses can only be up to 12 octets long.  CONSEQUENCES OF NON-ACCEPTANCE 1: Implementors may use too long addresses.  REASON 2: At the end of chapter 3.3 it is stated that it is possible for the TE to request the MT to both store and send the SMS message. It is unclear what happens to the stored message if the transmission fails after the storing has suceeded.  CONSEQUENCES OF NON-ACCEPTANCE 2: The TE does not know the message reference of this SMS message and thus has no means of pointing to it.  REASON 3: Section 3.1.2.2 defines GET NEXT MESSAGE command. right after GET FIRST MESSAGE command. GET NEXT MESSAGE command may give a wrong response in a situation where a session is started with a GET MESSAGE command. "

One approach is based upon use of the complete OSI reference model (see X.200), another approach is based upon the use of only the lower three OSI layers, and another approach is based upon the use of CCITT Signalling System No. 7 (see Q.700).  Alternative protocol stacks are specified via ASN.1 encoding rules (see X.208 and X.209). These alternative protocol stacks are examples for the implementation of the Short Message Relay Layer (SM-RL).

This is to ensure interoperability between a SIM and an ME independently of the respective manufacturers and operators. The concept of a split of the Mobile Station (MS) into these elements as well as the distinction between the GSM network operation phase, which is also called GSM operations, and the administrative management phase are described in the Technical Specification GSM 02.17 [6]. This ETS defines: - the requirements for the physical characteristics of the SIM, the electrical signals and the transmission protocols;  - the model which shall be used as a basis for the design of the logical structure of the SIM;  - the security features;  - the interface functions;  - the commands;  - the contents of the files required for the GSM application;  - the application protocol.  Unless otherwise stated, references to GSM also apply to DCS 1800. This ETS does not specify any aspects related to the administrative management phase. Any internal technical realisation of either the SIM or the ME are only specified where these reflect over the interface. This ETS does not specify any of the security algorithms which may be used. This ETS defines the SIM/ME interface for GSM Phase 2. While all attempts have been made to maintain phase compatibility, any issues that specifically relate to Phase 1 should be referenced from within the relevant Phase 1 specification. "

These requirements apply to terminals for phase 1 of the public land mobile radio service utilising constant envelope modulation, operating in the 900 MHz band with a channel separation of 200 kHz, and carrying 8 full rate traffic channels per carrier according to the Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) principle. This TBR covers the requirements for Global System for Mobile communications (GSM) access to the network. For each conformance requirement, one or more test purposes are given. For each test purpose, a single reference is given to the test method in GSM 11.10 (I-ETS 300 020-1) [2]. The requirements apply at the air interface and the SIM-ME interface for the access requirements, which may be stimulated to perform the tests by additional equipment if necessary. The measurement uncertainty is handled, as described in GSM 11.10 (I-ETS 300 020-1) [2]. This TBR covers the essential requirements of the Terminal Directive 91/263/EEC [1] Articles 4d, 4e, 4f. Non access related aspects of speech telephony, where Article 4g has been applied, are covered by TBR 9 [7]. The Terminal Directive 91/263/EEC [1] Articles 4a and 4b are covered by other directives, and, therefore, not by this TBR. In this TBR, there are no EMC technical requirements in terms of the Terminal Directive 91/263/EEC [1], Article 4c. NOTE: Technical Requirements for EMC performance and testing of the equipment are covered by the relevant standards applicable to the EMC Directive 89/336/EEC, Annex A. Terminal equipment may be subject to additional requirements in other Common Technical Regulations (CTR)ydepending on the equipments functionality. GSM 11.10 (I-ETS 300 020-1) [2] constitutes the full conformance test suite for GSM. The verification of the conformance requirements in this TBR are based on the tests described in this reference. The set of requirements in GSM 11.10 (I-ETS 300 020-1) [2] and the set of requirements in this TBR need not be identical. "
