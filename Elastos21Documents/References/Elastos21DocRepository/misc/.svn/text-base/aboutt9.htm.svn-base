T9 Chinese PTI	

PTI, the latest version of T9 Chinese Text Input, enables faster and easier 
	Chinese text entry on mobile devices. Users are able to save and retrieve 
	frequently used phrases or short sentences by entering the first letter of 
	the first few characters.Additional features include: modeless input, UDB phrase, Mohu 
	Pinyin, intelligent context prediction, reordering based on usage, and the 
	ability for stroke input, alternative strokes, etc.</p>
	<ul type="square">
		<li>
		<p style="line-height: 200%; margin-top: 0">&nbsp;

Chinese PTI supports both phonetic (Pinyin and BoPoMoFo) and stroke input methods in both Simplified and Traditional Chinese.

		</li>
		<li>
		<p style="line-height: 200%; margin-top: 0">Phrasal Pinyin or BoPoMoFo
	Phrasal Pinyin or BoPoMoFo allows users to input a phrase by continuously entering Pinyin or BoPoMoFo for the phrases without selecting each character first. For example: for the phrase "北京" users can enter the key sequence for "Beijing" or "ㄅㄟㄐ`ㄥ", and then select "北京" from the selection list. This feature also supports the Jianpin (简拼) feature that allows users to retrieve a phrase by entering the first pinyin letter of the first few characters. For example, the user would only need to type 'b' or 'bj' or 'bjd' or 'bjdx' to retrieve 北京大学.</li>
		<li>
		<p style="line-height: 200%; margin-top: 0">&nbsp;Stroke Input Stroke 
		Input allows users to input a phrase by entering the full or first few 
		strokes for each character in the phrase separated by a delimiter. For 
		example: to enter the phrase &quot;北京大学&quot; (Beijing University), if &quot;└┘&quot; 
		represents a delimiter, users can enter the full or partial stroke 
		sequence 丨 or 丨└┘丶 or 丨└┘丶└┘一 or 丨└┘丶└┘一└┘丶 to retrieve &quot;北京大 学&quot; from the 
		selection list.</li>
		<li>
		<p style="line-height: 200%; margin-top: 0">Mohu Pinyin
	Mohu Pinyin provides support for regional variances in pronunciation or spelling by interchanging Mohu pinyin pairs. For example: enter "ZongGuo"
to retrieve the phrase "中国" which has "ZhongGuo" as the correct Pinyin. 
</li>
		<li>
		<p style="line-height: 200%; margin-top: 0">User Database (UDB) Phrasal
	This feature allows users to add personal or commonly selected phrases which are not available in the phone database, such as names, personal addresses etc. Users just need to add a phrase once and it will be added to their personal dictionary. Additionally, PTI will position this newly added phrase earlier in the selection list. 
		</li>
		<li>
		<p style="line-height: 200%; margin-top: 0">Modeless Input
	This feature allows users to enter a message that includes both Chinese and English characters, numbers and symbols without switching modes.
Say, for example, a user wants to enter the message "你好, 我是Mary 请回电
123456789J", which is a combination of phrasal Pinyin, symbols (including emoticons), numbers and English characters. If the original input mode is Pinyin, the message can be completed in Pinyin mode with the following numeric key input: 64-1-97-6279-743-123456789-111. 
		</li>
		<li>
		<p style="line-height: 200%; margin-top: 0">Chinese Name Reordering
	This feature reorders Chinese names so that they appear first in the selection list. This is useful when entering contacts in a contact management application.
