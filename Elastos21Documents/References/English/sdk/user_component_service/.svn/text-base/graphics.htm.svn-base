    <p><b>Remarks: </b>Atlas graphics system of Elastos 2.0 is compatible with WinCE graphics system.All the 
    functions and message features are similar to that in WinCE. The difference is that Atlas only supports 
    Unicode encoding for now. This document only provides comparison table between Atlas and WinCE. For details,  
    see corresponding WinCE documentation.
