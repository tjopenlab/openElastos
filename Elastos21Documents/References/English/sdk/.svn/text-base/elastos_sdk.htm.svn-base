<h2> Introduction to Elastos.SDK </h2>
    <h3>What is Elastos.SDK</h3>
    <p>
    	Elastos.SDK provides a component based IDE for software developers on Windows 2000/XP platforms, which helps 
    	designers to fully utilise the CAR component technology. Elastos run-time engine technology is included with 
    	the SDK to develop application softwares for the Elastos run-time platform.
    </p>
    <p>
    	The CAR component based technology concept is fully materialized in the development process using the 
    	software development tools, component based platform interfaces and libraries, which is included in the SDK. 
    	Using the Elastos.SDK, designer can rapidly implement component based application without knowing the technical 
    	details of the components.
    </p>

    <h3>What can Elastos.SDK do</h3>
    <p>Elastos.SDK can help designers to do the following: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Develop component based applications fully compatible with Microsoft COM technology on the Windows 
        	operating system;
        <li>Develop Elastos application;
        <li>Debug Elastos application running on target system.
    </ul>
    <p>Elastos.SDK provides benefits to the following two categories of user: </p>
    <p>
    	For users developing applications on the Windows operating system, the SDK is helpful to develop component 
    	based applications fully compatible with Microsoft COM technology. At the same time, the Elastos.SDK 
    	provides <b>Carefree Application Run-Time (CAR)</b> and automation functionalities. This simplifies the software 
    	development processes, and helps the C/C++ programmers to master the component based programming 
    	methodology easily. Windows application programmers can fully use Elastos.SDK as their component based 
    	application development platform.
    </p>
    <p>The SDK is a must for users developing applications on Elastos operating system. Elastos SDK provides tools 
    	for CAR component based development environment, target system (embedded user system) communication, 
    	download, and remote debugging.
    </p>
    <p>
    	The Elastos.SDK component based software development methodology and technique is common for both Windows 
    	and Elastos applications.
    </p>

    <h3>Functionalities of Elastos.SDK</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Development environment and facility to organize and store source code and object files;
        <li>emake automated build environment, including <b>Carefree Application Run-Time (CAR)</b> and its compiler. 
        	Binary component which can be used to generate CAR technology based dynamic linkable objects or libraries; 
        <li>System function library;
        <li>System component library;
        <li>Header files for application development; 
        <li>Source code editor, common development tools, embedded system file transfer capability, integrated 
        	software debugger; 
        <li>Complete integrated technical documentation and plentiful sample programs.
    </ul>

    <h3>Characteristics of Elastos.SDK</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Provides complete component oriented application software development platform; 
        <li>Provides generic development environment for both Windows&nbsp;2000 application and Elastos operating 
        	system application;
        <li><b>Carefree Application Run-Time (CAR)</b> and the automated emake build environment provide automatic 
        	build mechanisms for CAR technology. Many complex component technology concepts and tedious 
        	programming descriptions are hidden from the software developers, which significantly simplify the 
        	component software development process; 
        <li>Cross-platform binary compatibility is fully realized in applications developed via the Elastos SDK; 
    </ul>

    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
    	To briefly summarize all of the above, the following figure shows the major architectural components of 
    	Elastos.SDK, as well as the software programming relationships among them:
