    <h2>Description Of SDK Different Development Environment</h2>
    <p>Detailed description of various SDK development environments: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>GNU.ElastosSDK&nbsp;X86.DBG: DEBUG version application compilation environment developed for Intel&nbsp;X86&nbsp;CPU, it uses GNU compilation tool. If an application source program has finished compilation, you can compile and link under this compilation environment. After compilation and adding link it generates DEBUG version target file and debug related information under the mirror directory of the current directory. Executable files developed under this environment can run on Elastos.
            <li>GNU.ElastosSDK&nbsp;X86.RLS: RELEASE version application compilation environment developed for Intel&nbsp;X86&nbsp;CPU. This compile environment is similar to GNU.ElastosSDK X86 DBG. The difference is that while compiling and linking under this compilation environment, the system automatically optimizes the generated target file and remove all the debug information of generated target file.This version cannot be debugged. In other words, application developed under this environment is the final optimized version without debug information.
            <li>GNU.ElastosSDK&nbsp;ARM.DBG: Similar to GNU.ElastosSDK&nbsp;X86&nbsp;DBG environment, it is a DEBUG version program compile environment for ARM&nbsp;CPU development.
            <li>GNU.ElastosSDK&nbsp;ARM.RLS: Similar to GNU.ElastosSDK&nbsp;X86&nbsp;RLS environment, it is a RELEASE version program compile environment for ARM&nbsp;CPU development.
            <li>GNU.ElastosSDK&nbsp;MIPS.DBG: Similar to GNU.ElastosSDK&nbsp;X86&nbsp;DBG environment, it is a DEBUG version program compile environment for MIPS&nbsp;CPU development.
            <li>GNU.ElastosSDK&nbsp;MIPS.RLS: Similar to GNU.ElastosSDK&nbsp;X86&nbsp;RLS environment, it is a RELEASE version program compile environment for MIPS&nbsp;CPU development.
            <li>GNU.ElastosSDK&nbsp;NT.DBG: NT virtual machine DEBUG version "Elastos Component Run-Time Platform" application compilation environment, it uses GNU compilation tools. This compilation environment is used to compile application that can run on "Elastos Component Run-Time Environment".
            <li>GNU.ElastosSDK&nbsp;NT.RLS: Similar to GNU.ElastosSDK&nbsp;NT.DBG environment, it is a RELEASE version "Elastos Component Run-Time Platform" application compilation environment.
            <li>MSVC.ElastosSDK&nbsp;X86.DBG: DEBUG version application compilation environment developed for Intel&nbsp;X86&nbsp;CPU uses Microsoft VC6.0 compilation tools. If an application source file is done, you can compile and link under this compilation environment. After compilation and linking it generates DEBUG version target file and debug related information under mirror directory of the current directory.Executable files developed under this environment can run on Elastos.It is not implemented now.
            <li>MSVC.ElastosSDK&nbsp;X86.RLS: RELEASE version application compilation environment developed for Intel&nbsp;X86&nbsp;CPU. This compile environment is similar to MSVC.ElastosSDK&nbsp;X86.DBG. The difference is that while compiling and linking under this compilation environment, the system automatically optimizes the generated target files.It cannot be debugged.It is not implemented now.
            <li>MSVC.ElastosSDK&nbsp;NT.DBG: DEBUG version "Elastos Component Run-Time Platform" application compilation environment for NT virtual machine, it uses Microsoft VC6.0 compilation tools. This compilation environment is used to compile application that can be executed on "Elastos Component Run-Time Platform".It is not implemented now.
            <li>MSVC.ElastosSDK&nbsp;NT.RLS: Similar to MSVC.ElastosSDK&nbsp;NT.DBG environment, it is RELEASE version "Elastos Component Run-Time Platform" application compilation environment.It is not implemented now.
            <li>EVC.ElastosSDK&nbsp;WINCE.DBG: DEBUG version "Elastos Component Run-Time Platform" application compilation environment for WINCE virtual machine, it uses Microsoft VC compilation tools. This compilation environment is used to compile applications that can run on "Elastos Component Run-Time Platform".It is not implemented now.
            <li>EVC.ElastosSDK&nbsp;WINCE.RLS: Similar to EVC.ElastosSDK&nbsp;WINCE.DBG environment, it is RELEASE version "Elastos Component Run-Time Platform" application compilation environment.It is not implemented now.
