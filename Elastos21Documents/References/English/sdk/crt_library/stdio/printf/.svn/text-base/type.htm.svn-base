<h2>printf Type Field Characters</h2>
    <p>The type character is the only required format field; it appears after 
any optional format fields. The type character determines whether the associated
argument is interpreted as a character, string or number. The types C and S 
and the behavior of c and s with <a class="style1" href="../wprintf.htm">printf</a> functions, are Microsoft extensions and 
are not ANSI compatible.  </p>

The e format is used only when the exponent of the value is less than 每4 or greater than or equal to the precision argument. Trailing zeros are truncated and the decimal point appears only if one or more digits follow it.
