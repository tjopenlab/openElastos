<h2> About "Elastos" C Run-Time Library</h2>

<p>Based on "Elastos", the C Run-Time Library is a subset of Standard C Library, it provided a way for user to develop applications and visit "Elastos" system resources.</p>

<p>"Elastos" is a UNICODE based operating system, it supports broad character version C Run-Time Library. However, for compatibility it continue supports ASCII based functions. If a function is named <b>str</b><i>function</i>, it means the function supports ASCII version. If a function is named <b>wcs</b><i>function</i>, it means the function supports UNICODE version. If a function is named <b>mbs</b><i>function</i>, it means the function supports multibyte character set (multibyte character: a character ocupies more than two bytes of memory) version. Many functions simply have two character set versions, namely <i>function</i> or <b>w</b><i>function</i>, the first naming is ASCII character set based, the second naming is wide character set (wide character: a character takes two bytes) based.</p>
<p>Besides, we introduced "Elastos" file input output modle, and related operation methods.</p>
