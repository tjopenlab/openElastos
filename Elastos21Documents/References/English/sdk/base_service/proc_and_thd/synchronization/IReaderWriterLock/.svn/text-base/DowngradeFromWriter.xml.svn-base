	<remarks>
		<para>
			This function is used to downgrade the acquired writer lock to reader lock (downgrades the 
			calling thread that has acquired the ReaderWriterLock object as a writer, to the one that acquires 
			the ReaderWriterLock object as a reader). The waiting of the calling thread will not occur during the downgrading process. The function will fail if the calling thread has not acquired the ReaderWriterLock object as a writer.
