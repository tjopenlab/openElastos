<h2> Introduction to Elastos agile kernel </h2>
    <h3>What is Elastos agile kernel</h3>
    <p>
    	Elastos fully utilizes the CAR concept. A CAR component can run in different address space or different 
    	run-time environment. The address space of the kernel is treated as a special address space, of which users have 
    	the flexibility to choose kernel address space or the user address space in order to run the system service 
    	component, file system, graphic system or device driver component. Comparing with the traditional operating 
    	system's <i>macro kernel</i> and <i>micro kernel</i>, the Elastos kernel service can be dynamically configured 
    	by the users as required. That is why, the Elastos kernel is considered as <b>Agile Kernel</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
    	Via the component and middleware technology, Elastos kernel system architecture resolves the trade offs 
    	between capability/efficiency and stability/security, which has pulzzed the operating system architects 
    	of the traditional macro/micro kernel for long time.

    <h3>Usage of CAR component technology in Elastos</h3>
    <p>
    	CAR technology is realized through the operating system kernel. It provides efficient and reliable services 
    	to the CAR component via the kernel facilities such as task management, scheduling, inter-process 
    	communication, incremental linking and loading of component, and services discovery. At the same time, the 
    	kernel itself becomes more modular by using the CAR technology, further enhance the kernel software management 
    	capability.
    </p>
    <p>
    	Elastos is based exactly on the above innovative concept. The Elastos Kernel and component library provided 
    	by the Elastos component run-time infrastructure are all realized via the CAR technology. The tight 
    	integration between the kernel and CAR technology provides powerful support for the <b>Agile kernel</b> of 
    	Elastos. This also efficiently achieves Elastos as a new generation of fully component based operating system.
    </p>
    <p>
    	The CAR technology increases the kernel size, but simply focus on the size of the kernel without considering 
    	the application is meaningless. The introduction of the CAR technology into the kernel will significantly 
    	reduce various application and operating system resource usage collectively.
    </p>
    <p>
    	Running binary component directly on the Elastos component platform fully complies with the rigid industrial 
    	requirements of run-time efficiency and real-time capability for embedded operating system. The execution 
    	time for binary code, the real CPU instruction flow, can be calculated and is predictable. Hence, the running 
    	time of the system is predictable. This simply cannot be achieved by other current virtual machine based system.
