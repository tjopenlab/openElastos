<h2> Introduction to Elastos component run-time platform </h2>
    <h3>What is Elastos component run-time platform</h3>
    <p>
    	Elastos component run-time platform provides a set of system service components that fit CAR criterion 
    	and component related API functions, and also supports system component and user component invocation. 
    	Elastos run-time platform makes it possible for different OS implemented applications that fit CAR 
    	criterion to achieve binary platform independence.
    </p>
    <p>
    	In Elastos, <b>Component run-time platform</b> and <b>Elastos Agile kernel</b> forms a complete operating 
    	system together.
    </p>
    <p>
    	In Windows&nbsp;2000, WinCE, Linux and other operating systems, Elastos run-time platform hides details of 
    	low level traditional operating systems and achieves a component oriented virtual machine. Applications 
    	developed on Elastos component run-time platform can run on traditional operating systems with the same binary 
    	code without change, and without much change in efficiency.
    </p>
    <p>
    	The following figure shows the position of Elastos run-time platform in Windows 2000/XP, and Elastos 
    	operating system.

    <h3>Functionalities of Elastos component run-time platform</h3>
    <p>
    	From the definition of Elastos component run-time platform, we know that, this platform provides run-time 
    	environment for CAR. From this point of view, we can say that CAR technology is a set of applications 
    	that support CAR criterion in the run-time environment.
    </p>
    <p>
    	From the programming point of view, Elastos component run-time platform provides a set of system service 
    	components and system APIs (Application Programming Interface), which form the foundation of developing 
    	applications on this platform.
    </p>
    <p>
    	Other component libraries provided by Elastos are also implemented by these system service components and 
    	system API. These component libraries provided by the system make application development a piece of cake: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Graphics System Component Library.
        <li>Device Driver Component Library.
        <li>File System Component Library.
        <li>Network System Component Library.</b>
    </ul>
    <p>
    	In Elastos component run-time platform, these components are all in the same level as applications. User can 
    	develop better or more suitable file system, network system and other component library to replace these 
    	component libraries provided by <i>Koretide Corp</i>. Users can also establish his or her own application 
    	component library.
    </p>
    <p>
    	The following figure shows the functionality of Elastos component run-time platform and the relationship 
    	between Elastos component run-time platform, component library, and application.
    </p>

    <p>
    	Elastos component run-time platform provides the following functionalities: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Generate component run-time environment automatically according to self discription of binary components, 
        	and dynamically load those components.
        <li>Provides component messaging mechanism. Messaging between components can be inter-process or across networks.
        <li>Monitor component status, and report errors etc.
        <li>Provides component status interruption mechanism, such as load balancing, process synchronization, 
        	access control, security (error tolerance) control, error report etc.
        <li>Component life-cycle management, such as system persistence control, transaction control etc.
    </ul>
    <p>Precisely, component run-time platform provides transparent run-time environment for programmers using 
    	CAR components. Components can run at different address spaces, in different environments, even across networks. 
    	Automatically, component run-time platform provides support for components, setting necessary network protocols, 
    	and corresponding I/O protocols. Programmers do not need to care such component interaction synchronization 
    	problems as network protocol conversion and component run-time control. The only thing a programmer needs to 
    	take care about is the algorithm of his or her own program. Programmers is been liberated from the cobweb of 
    	application environment system, improving programming efficiency.
    </p>
    <p>The Elastos run-time platform run the binary component directly. This is different from JAVA and .NET applications, 
    	which interprets and executes the intermediate byte code via the virtual machine. Therefore, comparing with 
    	other component based programming architecture, it possesses the advantages of minimal resource consumption, 
    	and high efficiency.
    </p>

    <h3>Programming benefits of Elastos component run-time platform</h3>
    <p>In the previous section, we discussed on the advantages of the Elastos run-time platform. To summarize, 
    	we emphasize the following: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Developing cross-platform applications;
        <li>Programmer transparent CAR component run-time environment, improve the programming efficiency;
        <li>Directly running the binary component code, achieves highly efficient software execution;
        <li>Replaceable component, and user-defined component.
    </ul>
    <p>Please note, the identical hardware system architecture requirement is a prerequisite for realizing the 
    	Elastos cross-platform application capability. Currently, the Elastos run-time platform is yet to be able 
    	to support cross-platform compatibility on CPUs with different instruction sets.
    </p>

    <h3>How to use Elastos component run-time platform</h3>
    <p>To a programmer, developing applications running on Elastos run-time platform, and specifically using CAR 
    	technology and cross-platform technology are all realized through the invocation of the component library 
    	interface and common function APIs. The dynamically linked library required by the application are 
    	automatically loaded while running the application.
    </p>
    <p>The following figure briefly illustrates the relationship between various critical components required for 
    	running the Elastos run-time platform application.

    <p>For details of methods, see <a class="style1" href="elastos_sdk.htm">Introduction to Elastos.SDK</a> in 
    	the manual, also how to use interface functions.
    </p>
    <p>Elastos Component Run-time Platform for Windows 2000/XP is included in softwares provided by this CD, also 
    	installed on PC automatically, under Elastos.SDK environment, it is easy to develop and run application 
    	software.
