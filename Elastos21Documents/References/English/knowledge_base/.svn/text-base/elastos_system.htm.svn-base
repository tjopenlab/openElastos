<h2> Introduction to Elastos Technology System </h2>

    <p>
    	Due to the development of network technology and the spreading of Internet, <b>Web Service</b> is becoming 
    	the main feature of next generation Internet application. He who controls Web Service technology, controls 
    	the future of software development. The key to realize web service are component, middleware programming 
    	technology, and the run-time environment and development environment associated with web service.
    </p>
