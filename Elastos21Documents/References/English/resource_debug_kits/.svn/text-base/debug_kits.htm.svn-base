    <h2>Elastos 2.0 Debugging Tool Introduction</h2>

    <h4>Software Debugging and Debugging Tool</h4>
        <p>	
        	Bugs are obvious while development and so testing is an essential step in the software 
        	development process. Problems appear in the development can be analyzed and solved by 
        	software testing. The following diagram shows the basic process of software product development flow. 
        	Problems detected in software testing can only be solved by repeatedly running and debugging, 
        	then the source of the bug can be found, program design can be modified.

        <p>
        	The important tool of software testing is software debugger. With debugger, we can perform operations 
        	such as read/write memory, read/write register, disassembly, single step execution, set breakpoint to 
        	the debugging program etc. The purpose of these operations is viewing state information and disposition 
        	data information in the debugging program.
        </p>
        <p>
        	There are obvious differences between embedded operating systems and all purpose desktop operating 
        	systems, in software testing environment. In desktop operating systems, the application and the debugger
        	usually run in the same computer as two processes and there by control and access the application processes 
        	through the debug interface provided by operating system. Due to the limited resources, 
        	embedded operating systems may lack human computer interaction capability, or does not support 
        	dynamic loading programming module, difficulty to directly run debugger etc. Therefore, embedded operating 
        	systems offer a set of tools for application developers, which can cross debug a software running in a 
        	special hardware platform (target system).

    <h4>Debugging Tool of Elastos</h4>
        <p>
        	Elastos offers two debugging tools for application developers: <b>GDB</b> and memory leak monitoring tool:
        	<b>memtrace</b>. 
        </p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>
                <a class="style1" href="gdb/gdb.htm">gdb</a>
                </td>
                <td>
                	GNU debugging tools with graphical interfaces, support assemble and source program debugging, 
                	it can debug target system even if system crashes.
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>

                </td>
                <td>
                	Memory leak monitoring tool.
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>
        	Memory leak monitoring tool--memtrace is a special tool. The tool exists only in Elastos DEBUG version 
        	and RELEASE version, not in NAKED version. It is an automatic tool not manual controlled, which is used for 
        	monitoring the occurrences of memory disclosure while the program exits, if any, and displays debugging 
        	information when a memory leak is detected.
        </p>
        <p>        	
        	The remote debugging tool provided with Elastos can perform source code level debugging and error finding
        	in the target system, using Internet or other communication environment. It can also upgrade or replace the
        	application components and can monitor or operate on the remote target system.
        	
        </p>
        <p>
        	Debugging tools of Elastos can debug operating system kernel. It is not only very convenient in system 
        	porting but also very useful in error diagnosis of system.
