    <h2>Protocol Stack</h2>
        <center><img src="images/stack.jpg"></center>
        <center>Image two: Basic Web Service Protocol</center>
        <p>Image two gives standard protocol for constructing basic Web service.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Simple&nbsp;Object&nbsp;Access&nbsp;Protocol: </b>Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) is a Note of W3C organization. It is a light weight protocol that describes how to exchange information in distributed environment. SOAP is a XML based protocol, which contains three sections: SOAP envelop, which defines the framework of what is the content in a description message, who sent it, who must accept and process it and how to process them. SOAP coding&nbsp;standard, represents data type instance used by application. SOAP&nbsp;RPC&nbsp;representation, is remote method invocation and answering protocol. SOAP can bind with multiple communication protocols, exchanging information using low level protocol. In this document, currently only defined the framework of how SOAP binds with HTTP and HTTP extension. This criterion can be obtained from W3C website: <a class="style1" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SOAP/">http://www.w3.org/TR/SOAP/</a>
        <li><b>Web&nbsp;Services&nbsp;Description&nbsp;Language (WSDL): </b>Web service description language (WSDL) is a Note of W3C, which defines network service as a group of end points using XML format.This group of end points is operating on messages containing documentation oriented or process oriented information. These operation and message description are abstract, then they are bound to specific network protocol and message format to define end point. Related end points are all combined as abstract end point service. WSDL can be extended to allow end point description and message.You do not need to consider using what kind of message format or network portocol to communicate. This means briefly define interfaces using XML mode and then bind these interfaces with specific representations that fits this protocol. Currently, this document only describes how to use WSDL and SOAP1.1£¬HTTP&nbsp;GET/POST together with MIME. This standard can be obtained from the W3C website: <a class="style1" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl">http://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl</a>.
        <li><b>UDDI (Universal&nbsp;Description, Discovery&nbsp;and&nbsp;Integration): </b>Universal&nbsp;Description, Discovery&nbsp;and&nbsp;Integration (UDDI) creates a platform independent, open framework, describe service, discover business and integrate business service through Internet. It is a set of Web based, distributed, Web service oriented information registration center implementation standard. It also includes a set of implementation standard visiting protocol that make enterprise able to register its own Web services so that other companies can discover them. This criterion can be obtained from Oasis&nbsp;Group: <a class="style1" href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/uddi-spec/">http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/uddi-spec/</a>.
    </ul>
        <p>Actually, there exists many standard protocols on top of these basic Web service protocols for solving service security and business work flow problems. Considering different Web service development tools support different protocols, we do not go into details about those differences in this section.</p>
        <p>You can obtain some main stream Web service development tools supported protocol list from the following: </p>
