<h2>CAR Component Custom Marshaling/Unmarshaling Mechanism</h2>
    <p>CAR component custom marshaling/unmarshaling mechanism is a custom marshaling/unmarshaling method for component instance interface pointer provided by CAR component run-time platform. By using CAR component custom marshaling/unmarshaling mechanism, the developer can control parameter passing process and influences return value when remotely passing interface pointer type parameters.</p>
    <p>From the design concept point of view, custom marshaling/unmarshaling mechanism on one hand is an extension to CAR component run-time platform provided remote process invocation based technology.On the other hand it depends on remote process invocation technology provided by CAR component run-time platform itself. Comparing with other technologies of the same category (For example custom mechanism in Microsoft&nbsp;DCOM), most significant advantage is that its logic structure is more clear.</p>
    <p>This section introduces CAR component custom marshaling/unmarshaling mechanism from the following perspectives: </p>
    <ul>
        <li><a class="style1" href=cust_marshal_elements.htm>Principle of CAR component custom marshaling/unmarshaling mechanism</a>
        <li><a class="style1" href=cust_marshal_samples.htm>CAR component custom marshaling/unmarshaling mechanism samples</a>
        <li><a class="style1" href=runtime_interface.htm>CAR component run-time interface mechanism</a>
    </ul>
    <p>Before you read the material in this section, you must already have an understanding of CAR component run-time platform <a class="style1" href="">remote procedure call technology</a>.</p>
