<h2>Basic Features Of CAR Component Click And Run</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><h4>On demand</h4>
            <p>Click and run always occurs when the user requires or is interested in some subject, and need learn more about the touch off the "click" event, it is typical on demand feature.</p>
        <li><h4>Load and play</h4>
            <p>Before the click event occurs, the correlative CAR component exist in the local/remote machine. After the click event occurs, the system will search the corresponding path or download it from the specified URL, download in time, install in time, service in time, it has the load and play feature.</p>
        <li><h4>User transparent</h4>
            <p>The user transparent includes two aspects: One is that in the default case the CAR component related by the click and run event need not be installed or be maintained by user, it is searched, downloaded, installed and run by the system automatically. The other is CAR component as a programming model, though it did many extensions to the Microsoft COM in the data structure and functions, but to the users it greatly simplifies the programming process, removed some component managment such as the reference count, in the click and run progress, it appears that the user need not care about through which interface or method the CAR component was loaded, but focus on the applications.</p>
        <li><h4>Network universal</h4>
            <p>The CAR component may exist in the local machine or somewhere in the Internet. We consider the local machine as a part of the Internet, the reason that the CAR component need not be installed before using is that usually most CAR component exist in the remote network, and the system will search in the network according to the defined policy when the click event occurrs. The basic method of the click and run mode has universal meanings in the local area network, Internet and wireless network.</p>
