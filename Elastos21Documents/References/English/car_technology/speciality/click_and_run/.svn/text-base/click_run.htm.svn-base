<h2>CAR Component Click And Run Mechanism</h2>
        <p>Click and run means that the software need not to be installed to the local machine but click the correlative subject or object (Button, picture, scroll bar etc.) in the network to upload component on demand then supply the appropriate service to the application in the network environment. The core thinking of the click and run is that the system supply the high automatical service supporting to the application.</p>
    <h3>The Significance Of Component Click And Run</h3>
        <p>There are two important significances of component click and run: </p>
        <ol>
            <li>It changed the basic model of the program running. The traditional model is: Install the software-&gt;run the software-&gt;supply service. In the click and run environment, if the software to supply some service is not installed, the system will search it in the local/remote machine automatically, then install it automatically when find the correlative software, load/run and supply the service immediately.
            <li>The installed software is limitted to the single machine. In the whole network environment, we are often interested in some hot subject application/program and the installed software cannot meet the requirement of the network application, so it is necessary to supply a solution to meet the requirement.
        </ol>
    <h3>Component click and run security</h3>
        <p>Security is very important to the application and computation in the network environment. It includes two aspects: One is whether the click and run component was signatured by the copyright holder. The other is whether the click and run component supplies the right service. If there is not any signature of the copyright holder in the component, the component is not security, the system will give a warning to the clicker to hope the component not running. If it is signatured, but there are several same named component with different versions in the local machine or the specified URL, the verison manager will choose an appropriate version to run according to the correlative rules.</p>
        <p>About the CAR component click and run version management and correlative rules and how to dertermine which version of the component should be loaded. See <a class="style1" href="../version/about_version.htm">"The version management of the CAR component"</a> for reference. In this chapter we mostly explain the CAR component click and run mechanism in the network environment.</p>
    <p>In this chapter, we will introduce the CAR component click and run mechanism in the following aspect: </p>
