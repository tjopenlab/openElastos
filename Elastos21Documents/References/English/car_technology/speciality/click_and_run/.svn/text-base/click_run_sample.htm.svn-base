<h2>The Application Sample Of Click And Run In WAP Browser</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>As figure 1 shows, there are many subjects on the desktop: Communications, settings, assistants, games, network, accessories, etc. The attention subject or information is expressed by red color. Click the "network" icon, you can see some applications related to the network, as figure 2 shows. The "Browser" in it is the WAP browser.

    <li>Figure 3 is the simplified user interface of the WAP browser, you can input the address of the WAP website through the URL edit box, such as: wap.elastos.com.cn. The browser will display the content of the website, it includes some on-line news, network games, etc. By choosing "Games" subject, the browser will display a page layout like figure 4, the content of the page shows some simple information of the network game.</br>
        In figure 4, if we are interested in the fractal game subject, click the "fractal game" or the corresponding icon. According to the correlative rules, the system will search the component in the network and make a security verifying automatically. If the component passes the verification, download it automatically and run in time. At this time the content of the browser as figure 4 shows, the game dynamically demonstrates a beautiful fractal picture.

    <li>As a demonstration, we particularly expatiate the whole process from the "click" to the "run". Usually, considering the security of the network, we can configure the correlative option in the browser to give us some prompt in the whole process, and run after we confirm. Such as, in each figure from figure 4 to figure 7, the system gives out the correlative confirm information. And then, when clicking the "Fractal game" icon, the web page will show the information about the game (as figure 5 shows), and provide a hyperlink of the "download and run" to the user. The user clicks the hyperlink, the browser will download the corresponding CAR component automatically (DLL module formatted executive program). The interface of download as figure 6 shows, user can know the progress of the downloading, and can cancle the downloading in the midway.

    <li>After downloading finishes, the browser will popup another dialog box, as figure 7 shows, query the user whether load and run the downloaded component, if the user clicks "OK" button, this CAR component will be loaded and executed by browser HOST, image eight is the beautiful graphics whe running "fractal" component.

    <li>At last, after component finishes or user terminates, the interface will go back to the browser interface when "click" event happens (image four). The system determines according to related browser configuration whether keep to downloaded component in certain directory or imediately delete it.
