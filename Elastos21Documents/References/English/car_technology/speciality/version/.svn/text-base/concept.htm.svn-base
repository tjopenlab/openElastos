<h2>Basic Concept Of Version</h2>
    <h3>Definition</h3>
    <p>Specifies the location of a component in the previous and current versions in the same component that is released multiple times. Version can be used to specify a component in released software package or component library or define the version of component in a series of versions.</p>
    <h3>Significance</h3>
    <p>There are two significances in using versions. The first significance is that it can identify specific component that is released at the same time and belongs to the same group (software package or component library), usually directly described by its name. For example: Mouse driver component in Elastos driver component software package. Here,it describes the limited number of component made in a certain time. The second significance is that for certain component, it defines the order relationship between the component and all its previous versions and the upcoming versions, which is most important in software upgrade process.</p>
    <h3>Usage</h3>
    <p>The fundamental usage of version is to identify specific component in this software package or component library, to provide the development background information, date and time the component is generated etc.</p>
    <p>When the component library is compiled multiple times, changes either big or small can happen between component libraries.The accurate identification of the component version distinguishes the component from other similar component. Other similar component includes previous or latter versions of the component or specific components that belong to different versions.</p>
    <p>Relationships between versions can explain the transform of concept. Some versions that contain important change or addition/deletion, hold historical value. It is possible for the legend, functionality and the way to use some component to change according to version.</p>
