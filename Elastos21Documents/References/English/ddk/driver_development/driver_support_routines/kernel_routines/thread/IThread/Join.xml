	<remarks>
		<para>
            The current thread calls this method to wait for the associated thread to exit. The current thread
			is put to the waiting list and is called after the associated thread terminates or time is out.
			The current execution thread waits for the associated thread to exit in specified time. If the
			associated thread does not exit by the end of the interval because the request to terminate is
			denied, then S_TIMED_OUT is returned to the calling procedure. E_FAIL is returned if the thread is
			not started. The largest possible value of a 32-bit integer represents infinity on the operating system. When ticks equals INFINITE, the current process waits until the associated process is finished or till it gets interrupted by another thread.
