	<remarks>
        <para>
        	This method is used to acquire the ReaderWriterLock object as a writer. If the calling thread cannot
        	acquire a writer lock (In case, the ReaderWriterLock object is acquired by one or more readers), it
        	will enter the waiting state, until the writer lock of the ReaderWriterLock object is acquired, and
        	the method returns successfully. If no other threads acquire the ReaderWriterLock object, the
        	calling thread will acquire it as a writer successfully, and the method returns immediately. If the
        	calling thread has already acquired the ReaderWriterLock object as a reader or writer, the method
        	will fail and cause unknown errors. The waiting of the calling thread can be interrupted.
		</para>

		<para> 
			The reader or writer threads of the ReaderWriterLock object can not call this method, otherwise, 
			will get unpredictable results.
