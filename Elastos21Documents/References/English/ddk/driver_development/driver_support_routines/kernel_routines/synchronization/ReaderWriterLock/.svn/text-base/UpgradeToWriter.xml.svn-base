	<remarks>
	    <para>
	    	This method is used to upgrade the acquired reader lock to writer lock . If calling thread can not
	    	upgrade to acquire a writer lock of the ReaderWriterLock object (In case, a ReaderWriterLock object
	    	is acquired by one or more readers), it will enter the waiting state, until the writer lock of the
	    	ReaderWriterLock object is acquired, and the method returns successfully. The waiting of the calling 
	    	thread can be interrupted.
		</para>
		<para>
			If the calling thread has not acquired the ReaderWriterLock object as a reader, the method will fail 
			and causes unpredictable results.</para>
