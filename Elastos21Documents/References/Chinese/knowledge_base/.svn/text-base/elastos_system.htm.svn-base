<h2> Introduction to Elastos Technology System </h2>

    <p>As the development of network technology and the spread of Internet, Web Service is becoming the main feature of next generation Internet application. He who controls Web Service technology, controls the future of software development. The key to realize web service are component, middleware programming technology, and the run-time environment and development environment associated with web service.</p>
    <p>The products and technology of Koretide Corp., represent web service oriented component based programming technology system.</p>
    <p>This article gives an introduction to the major technologies in Elastos technology system. It intends to give reader a general idea about the concept of Elastos technology system, helping them to understand the rest of this guide.</p>
    <p>Elastos technology system contains the following parts: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>CAR component technology: component oriented programming model and criterion.
            <li>Elastos component run-time platform: CAR component run-time environment, support cross platform application.
            <li>Elastos operating system: component based, embedded operating system.
            <li>Elastos agile kernel: component based "agile" kernel architecture.
            <li>Elastos SDK: component oriented application IDE (Integrated Development Environment).
        </ul>

    <p>The following diagram shows the relationship between these technologies and user application.</p>
