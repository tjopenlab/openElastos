<h2> Introduction to Elastos.SDK </h2>
    <h3>What is Elastos.SDK</h3>
    <p>Elastos.SDK provides a component based IDE for software developers on Windows 2000/XP platforms. It helps designers fully utilizing the CAR component technology, Elastos run-time engine technology included with the SDK to develop application software for the Elastos run-time platform.</p>
    <p>The CAR component based technology concept is fully materialized in the development process using the software development tools, component based platform interfaces and libraries included in the SDK. Using the Elastos.SDK, designer can rapidly implement component based application without knowing the technical details of the components.</p>

    <h3>What can Elastos.SDK do</h3>
    <p>Elastos.SDK can help designers do the following: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Develop component based application, fully compatible with Microsoft COM technology, on the Windows operating system;
        <li>Develop Elastos application;
        <li>Debug Elastos application running on target system.
    </ul>
    <p>Elastos.SDK provides benefits to the following two categories of user: </p>
    <p>For users developing application on the Windows operating system, the SDK can help to develop component based applications fully compatible with Microsoft COM technology. At the same time, the Elastos SDK provides CAR (Component Assembly Runtime) component definition language and automation functionalities. This simplifies the software development processes, and helps the C/C++ programmers to master the component based programming methodology easily. Windows application programmers can fully use Elastos.SDK as their component based application development platform.</p>
    <p>For users developing application on Elastos operating system, the SDK is a must. Elastos SDK provides tools for CAR component based development environment, target system (embedded user system) communication, download, and remote debugging.</p>
    <p>The Elastos.SDK component based software development methodology and technique is common for both Windows and Elastos applications.</p>

    <h3>Functionalities of Elastos.SDK</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Development environment and facility to organize and store source code and object files;
        <li>emake automated building environment, including CAR (Component Assembly Runtime) component definition language and its compiler. Binary component which can be used to generate CAR technology based dynamic linkable objects or libraries; 
        <li>System function library;
        <li>System component library;
        <li>Header files for application development; 
        <li>Source code editior, common development tools, embedded system file transfer capability, integrated software debugger; 
        <li>Complete integrated technical documentation and plentiful sample programs.
    </ul>

    <h3>Characteristics of Elastos.SDK</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Provide complete component oriented application software development platform; 
        <li>Provide generic development environment for both Windows&nbsp;2000 application and Elastos operating system application;
        <li>CAR (Component Assembly Runtime) component definition language and the automated emake building environment provide automatic building mechanisms for CAR technology. Many complex component technology concepts and tidious programming descriptions are hidden from the software developers, which significantly simplify the component software development process; 
        <li>Cross-platform binary compatibility is fully realized in applications developed via the Elastos SDK; 
    </ul>

    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>To briefly summarize all of the above, the following figure shows the major architectural components of Elastos.SDK, as well as the software programming relationships among them: </p>
