<h2> Introduction to Elastos agile kernel </h2>
    <h3>What is Elastos agile kernel</h3>
    <p>Elastos fully utilizes the CAR concept, the CAR component can run in different address space or different run-time environment. The address space of the kernel is treated as a special address space, the user can choose to run the system service component, file system, graphic system, device driver component either in the kernel address space or the user address space flexibly. Comparing with the traditional operating system's "macro kernel" and "micro kernel", the Elastos kernel service can be dynamically configured by the user as required. That is why, the Elastos kernel is considered a "Agile Kernel".</p>
    <p>Via the component and middleware technology, Elastos kernel system architecture resolves the trade offs between capability/efficiency and stability/security, which has pulzzed the operating system architects of the traditional macro/micro kernel for long time.</p>

    <h3>Usage of CAR component technology in Elastos</h3>
    <p>CAR technology is realized through the operating system kernel. It provides efficient and reliable services to the CAR component via the kernel facilities such as task management, scheduling, inter-process communication, incremental linking and loading of component, and services discovery. At the same time, the kernel itself becomes more modular by using the CAR technology, further enhance the kernel software management capability.</p>
    <p>Elastos is based exactly on the above innovative concept. The Elastos Kernel and component library provided by the Elastos component run-time infrastructure are all realized via the CAR technology. The tight integration between the kernel and CAR technology provides powerful support for the "agile kernel" of Elastos. This also efficiently achieves Elastos as a new generation of fully component based operating system.</p>
    <p>The CAR technology increases the kernel size, but simply focus on the size of the kernel without considering the application is meaningless. The introduction of the CAR technology into the kernel will significantly reduce various application and operating system resource usage collectively.</p>
    <p>Running binary component directly on the Elastos component platform fully complies with the rigid industrial requirements of run-time efficiency and real-time capability for embedded operating system. The execution time for binary code, the real CPU instruction flow, can be calculated and is predictable. Hence, the running time of the system is predictable. This simply cannot be achieved by other current virtual machine based system.</p>
